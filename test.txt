It makes you have empathy for all the people who are sick in this world   They know they are dying but try to do the best they can to have a somewhat normal life  It would be hard to carry on   It was sad
As the characters were developed it was easy to see the person rather than the disease  I would recommend this book to anyone who knew someone who had a possibly fatal disease  That would be almost anyone
John Green has let his wonderful words splay out across the pages of this book in a way that makes my heart FEEL the emotion how I've never felt before Nothing to change add or lose Perfect Just perfect
I chose thise book because I saw where it was a movie and I was just curious  It was not sappy like it had the potential to beand I think it would be an awesome read for high schoolers or young adults
The lives and loves of seriously ill cancer patients is seen through the lens of an affected 16 year old girl The story line is simple but the interactions of family and friends is sensitive and insightful
I decided to read the book after watching the movie with a friend it's even better than the movie makes you stop and rethink who and what you are in this existence love and fear are the only true emotions
There is no glamour in cancer no heroic battle  just a fight to get over and accept it This was very plAin talk about that fight Told with grace and humid and the sense that life continues no matter what
I absolutely loved this book it was heartwarming and breaking but it will truly truly touch your heart as it did to mine This book was the best I have read in a while And this is coming out of a 11 year old
beautifully written with bright and interesting dialogue  but are we manipulated at the end manipulated into some sort of unbelievable fairy tale that somehow makes this touching story trite  i'm not sure
When you read a story like this you hope the pages and the end come swiftly but then when it is over you weep that there is no more Read with a tissue but the good kindthe stuff that holds together well
This book was amazing but unfortunately I made the mistake to leave my box of tissues on the table when I picked up my kindle It's so sad at the endingbut it's a wonderful book  :(  and :) at the same time
The references to Hazel's favorite book are so well written you want to read it as soon as you're done with TFIOS A predictable plot twist or two but still a book you won't want to put down until it's done
I'm heartbrokenly in love with it Don't know if that makes sense to anyone It's just one of those books that you can't stop thinking about Even after finishing this book My emotions are still a whirlwind
I am going to watch the movie I want to know if my imagination matches some of the big screen I can almost smell the hospital and I for sure see the loving moments between the characters I love their love
This book was more than amazing it taught me how to be teenager in this crazy world we call life and I'm thankful for this book and every message it taught this is my all time favorite book of all time üò¢üòçüòò
I would recommend this book to everyone I was not able to put it down for 2 days then it was complete and I wished for more I do have to admit that the last few chapters are tear markers but well worth it
The best thing about this book is its brutal honesty that oblivion is inevitable There is nothing sugar coated and you see cancer patients as going through a time when they're pathetic and don't want to be
Love it Very well written Highly recommending it to my friends Not overly technical but enough to make you connect better with the character Can't wait for the movie and got it does the book justice
Very enjoyable book however as much as I did enjoy 9948% there is the restI would definitely recommend this book for young people if for nothing more-but the thoughts feelings and vocabulary lesson
This was a wonderful book to read  I have told some many of my friends to purchase it and read it  We plan to go as a group and watch the movie  Download or purchase this book you will not be disappointed
It's the great love story that does not end well But at the same time the ending was the best part The characters are vibrant and alive Passion is a big part of this book You won't be able to put it down
This really was the most beautiful book I've ever read When you first start reading it you think it will be so predictable but it's not  It's such a great story and the characters are portrayed beautifully
Great storyreally tugged on my heart strings Don't think the movie will be able to do it justice Recommend the book to all ages to really understand the struggles of those w cancer or a terminal disease
I could recommend this to anyone with a heart Especially the observing type It's a book full of life and emotions and it's been a long time that I laughed or/and cried so hard on a story Very well written
This book was brought to my attention by a few friends  On their recommendation I started reading it  After a while I couldn't put it down and needed tissues  It was a beautiful story that touched my heart
This is one of those books that at the moment you finish it you have no idea what to do with your life It was absolutely breathtaking and it left me in awe I absolutely loved loved LOVED this book
Omg this is an amazing book It has the romance and the parts were you cry I just love this book I recommend this book to everyone Please take the time to read this inspiring and wonderful story Thank you
Unimaginably inspiring I have just finished reading this book and can I just say well done john green I'm obsessed with your work  this book looking for Alaska am abundance of Katharines I just adore you
It's such a beautiful book so well written It tells the true perspective of a cancer ridden girl But she's not some pathetic pitiful teenager She's full of life even though she may not have one for now
I highlighted a lot of this book Maybe because I'm a nurse Maybe because I'm a seminarian Maybe because because what Not sure what to say that will not leave a scar - yet we do choose those that hurt us
Awesome read How unselfish insightful these terminally ill characters were I cheered for them and cried with them  It's been a long while since a novel has grabbed a hold of me in such a personal fashion
This book is amazing and heart breaking I love this book so much and will be rereading it several times If you ever have time to read read this book and make sure you have some tissues near by when you do
I really enjoyed this book I was hesitant to pick it upthinking it would be really depressing I was very happy that I only cried at certain parts rather than the entire book The book is very well written
I'm over 50 now but I still love stories or movies involving adolescence and/or the transition to adulthood This life isn't fair and sometimes time can run out way too early Great story and I recommend it
I found myself in tears several tines in this book John Green has the ability to make you feel/hurt for every character in this book I feel as though I will forever view cancer differently Thanks to Hazel
this book is a good way to remember that people with cancer should not give up but enjoy every moment of their lives as much as they canI wanted to know what happens to Hazel Grace at the end though :(
It's a bit predictable but it is BEAUTIFUL I cried a lot I wasn't sure about reading this at first because I thought it'd be pretty cliche but it's one of the best books I've read in a while ITS FANTASTIC
When Augustus Waters died of ostiosarcoma (bone cancer) i freaked out when he was at the store trying to buy cigarettes i said to myself He's gonna die Although it was an amazing book after all Loved it
Personally I really liked this book It made me laugh smile and even cry near the end I wouldn't say the book was the best book I have ever read but I would recommend it if you're looking for a good book
Read this after watching the film I'm sure everyone knows the story by now So I'll keep it short and say I enjoyed revisiting this story via literature Not too much difference between the two Great read
Not that all scars are bad things - just evidence of living or a side effect of dying  I'm glad I did not give this book as a Christmas present but I still highly recommend living and getting those scars
I liked this book a great deal  The strength of the characters outweighed any lapse into the sad nature of their reality  This is a book about transcendence and beauty in the face of tragedy  A must read
I was expecting a sad story but what was pleasantly surprising was the humor in the characters and the raw emotions also this book was wonderfully written and I hope that everyone enjoys it as much as I did
This is a heartbreaking story However I didn't feel quite as if it were heartbreaking right away I feel like I fell in love with Hazel Grace and Augustus Waters story of falling in love Brilliantly told
I Learned about this book from my 14 year old niece Everyone on of my sisters (6) and nieces have now read it It is well written full of humor and interesting personalities My husband is now enjoying it
This is the first book in a very Long time that I have read that I did not want it to ever end I actually would back up and 're read chapters so it wouldn't end Talented writer entertaining captivating
Enjoyed this book but won't see the movie It's well written with realistic characters in a dark situation Really liked the honest take on teenagers attitudes And a good description of likeable families
Great book Loved John Green's writing style - he really brought the characters to life Such a true version of a sad story eye opening to read the story of terminal dieses through the eyes of young adults
I loved the book But the movie was great What a romantic tragedy yet funny Note: if you like to cry throughout a movie this book/movie is for you I do recommend reading the book before seeing the movie
If you like having an author manipulate and toy with your emotions then read this bookor better yet just read my review http://momvsworldblogspotcom/2014/07/the-fault-with-book-fault-in-our-starshtml
I didn't want to read this book but after many friends suggested I do I did My reason for not wanting to read it was spot on It's moving It hurt I am however thankful that I did because I am still here
I actually thought I was going to cry but the tears never came I really enjoyed the book I was impressed by the characters and the strength they had especially for their ages It's a quick and easy read
I've heard all about this book It's put every sensual person in tears and I am no exception Can you purchase a Gus Kind of reminded me of the movie A Walk To Remember anyone else A must read
Engaging and well written but the hopelessness of these young people and their families is sad  These are the kind of characters that you think about after finishing the book  Can't wait to see the movie
I truly wanted to love this book It's difficult not to be moved in some measure by the circumstances Hazel and Gus find themselves in but it isn't enough to carry the weak story and odd twists and turns
This book was such a breath of fresh air While we watch struggle with our own immortality it's important to sometimes simply stop examine and feel what others are going through I truly enjoyed this book
Unlike the movie I found myself emotionally much more involved in the lives of the two young cancer patients  Also liked that the parents were not portrayed as the enemy as in so many books featuring teens
The Fault in Our Stars is a literary feast for the mind and soul The story is full of hope and hurt love and loss beauty and sadness written with well-chosen words and phrases A must-read for the masses
This book was disappointing on many levels I would not recommend it to anyone nor will I see the movie It wasn't a hopeful funny or entertaining book It as very metaphorical but in an over the top way
This book is my absolute favorite It's not just a teenage love story but it's adventurous moving sad and makes you question the importance of life 20/10 would recommend this book to everyone and anyone
This book is well written and makes you fall in love with the characters the first time they are mentioned I am going to read this book twenty times or more because it is the most perfect little love story
This book was one of the best books I have ever read Once I started to read this book I couldn't put it down This story was both heart wrenching and heart warming and it has changed the way I look at life
It was witty and a fantastic read Several times I found myself laughing and crying at the same time Warning do not read in a public place You might be wiping tears away while trying not to let anyone see
I loved this book It was painstakingly real but wonderful all at the same time A story about imperfect people in perfect love You'll laugh out loud for real and cry so hard you'll hurt It's worth it all
Love love love this book  I am not the best reader and tend to put books down before they are finished but NOT this book  I finished it in a few days which is quite remarkable for myself  A true gem
One of the most compelling stories I have read this year Will DEFINITELY be seeing the movie version The subject matter is intense but you immediately become engrossed in the lives of the main characters
I found the book to be very predictable The teenagers although definitely going through teen years with a lot on their plate didn't ring true as teenagers to me I would not recommend this book to anyone
JOHN GREEN is one of my favorite authors and he has not let me down ONCE with any of his books I highly recommend this comedic tragedy as it will make your heart break and your sides hurt at the same time
The characters were interesting and real  Their love story while brief was epic  Hazel's transformation from isolated hermit to socializing and choosing to experience her life in a new way was inspiring
First off do not read this book in front of other people starting around 60% (if you are on a kindle) It's a tear jerker  This book touched all my senses and I loved every character  Thank you John Green
I loved this book It was very touching at I cryed a little and I'm sure other people did too  The only other book that was this good so far that I've read was the divergent series This was an amazing book
To put it simply this magnificent book is beautifully written and was completely capable of snatching up my emotions and running with themI don't care if you have nerves of steel You will sob
This book was a page turner and kept me thinking about it long after I put it down each day I really enjoyed the side of terminal illness this author shared Nothing was held back It was raw and wonderful
I would recommend this to anyone over 13 it is a great story of love loss and tragedy My reason for 13 and over Is mild sexual content and language Amazing I could not put it down and neither will you
I'm not finsihised reading this book but so far the book is really good I heard a lot about this book all over tumblr instagram  facebook and my peers I really like how the has a little dark humor in it
Just the right touch of teenage romance peppered in realmasterfully captured internal conflicts of the ill If you've ever been so fortunate and un- to have a burden of illness this book will hit you hard
From begining to end it's just a great book Knocking it down a star because of the book within a book sequences Seriously I think he talks about three different fictional books within this work of fiction
Cancer in children cannot be construed as humorous by any stretch of the imagination but somehow the author is able to bring a delicate and wonderful humor out while bringing you to tears I loved this book
Deep warm funny and inspiring So good I laughed while i read this and I cried while I read this I fell so in love with these deep characters It was well worth the heartache to meet Hazel and Augustus
I bought this book originally for my Kindle so I could read it myself I decided to get it for a friend for Christmas and ordered it from here Shipping was a little slow but the book is in good condition
I absolutely love this book I generally don't re-read books (because there's too many on the list to back track) but this one I would re-read in a heart beat It's everything you could ever want in a book
Wonderfully written story with wonderful characters Although this is a book about children with cancer it is smart witty and engaging  It's more a story about living than dying Insightful and charming
This is an amazing book such inspiration and heart ache Not the basic happy ending but none the less I kinda feel like Hazel now with knowing how's Anna's mother except how's Anna What happens to Hazel
I really enjoyed reading a book about such a terrible disease that could even so light up some pretty impressive feelings like love and kindness I'll definitely remember Augustus and Hazel for a long time
I waited a long time for this book I preordered it months in advance I knew what I was in for but that still did not prepare me for it This book scared me after I read the first few pages I put it down and didn't touch it for over a month I would stare at it everyday but I couldn't read it Here is why this book talks about Cancer (this is just a small part of what this book is about) but at the mention of Cancer I pulled the eject cord and I WAS OUT My husband has Kidney Cancer I've lost three other family members to Cancer I was sick of hearing or reading about it But I came back because I wasn't going to let Cancer take anything else away from me including this book that I had been waiting months for I'm thankful that I won that battle because this book is amazing and to have missed out on it would have been a huge regret to me I feel this book should be put on required reading lists at every school that has required reading lists In my 29 years of life I've read around 300 books and I would with out a doubt say The fault in our stars is in my Top ten favorite list So if you're reading this review and you want to know if you should get this book my answer is Yes
Why did I like this story  This book made me more thankful for my time on this Earth and all the experiences big or small I have had  Truly a beautiful thought-provoking story with wonderful characters
I liked this book but it wasn't something I LOVED I personally didn't connect well with John Green's writing style and it threw me off a little I really liked the story line Just not how it was written
I'm not a huge book reader but this book really got me started There is the romance the conflicts scariness and the sadness all wrapped up in one book It is the most amazing book that I have ever read
Descent read  With the exception of the osteosarcoma  not sure that the list of tumors in the therapy group participants was epidemiologically realistic though the lay person wouldnt know the difference
This book gave me chills I couldn't stop thinking about this book after finishing reading it John Green did a terrific job displaying characters and scenes I would read any and every book written by him
I LOVED EVERYTHING ABOUT THIS BOOK the dialogue the story line the characters  THAT AUGUSTUS WATERS‚ù§Ô∏è I fell in love with this book the way you fall asleep slowly and then all at once -Hazel Grace Lancaster
This was a hard book for me to read  It's bucket list-ish and while the message of living your life was prominent the age of the characters made it difficult for me  Still worth reading though
It is a heart book even though Augustus waters dies  It is Sooooooooooo sad I wish he didn't But like they on the  Tuck Everlasting cover  A beautifully written book that can't be put down forgottened
Top grade novel probably ruined a little bit by the movieI bawled like a baby  throughout the story my emotions dragged all over the place by the beautifully worked plotLoved it
I wasn't sure about a novel that has already been turned into a major film but I enjoyed it and although it is a story that many will consider sad reminded me that we all have a great courage inside of us
Kept my attention from beginning to end so sad I was in tears by the end of the book This story really brings to light the struggle of those suffering with cancer as well as it's effect on their families
I read this at the request of my teenage granddaughter and thought it would be a typical sad love story Although it was an easy read it did have some depth and philosophy of life in it I truly enjoyed it
I was left speechless not crying but was not happy but not sad john green needs to write another miracle for this is no book it is a miracle prepare to embrace your poetic side with the fault in our stars
I don't care if this is supposed to be a teen book Any book that makes me cry at the 80% mark is a winner Hazel Grace is a great smart strong woman  I highly recommend meeting her and read this book
This is the best book ive ever read You definitely want to read it before you see it You'll fall in live with their love John Green is a brilliant writer and i hope you love the book#worththemoney
This book is the best book in the world to me I feel like I'm just like Hazel Grace It's romantic and sad too witch I like I wish I could find out what happens to Hazel and her parents and Gus's parents
I didn't like how you had them reading a book with no sequence it just didn't make any since to me I gave a 2 star cause it took me at least a month to keep reading Maybe young teens would enjoy it more
The fault in our stars was many things emotional poetic and sometimes funny But the part that I loved the most was the letter it had all of these ideas that needed to be put into words I LOVED THIS BOOK
From start to finish you feel the importance of every moment of life caring for others selflessly and reflecting on the impact of love in our lives Beautifully written easy read and highly recommended
Having had a son who died at the age of four in an accident I loved the funny way the characters in the book relate to each other's tragedy It makes me think that's how my son would have felt about death
I recommend this book to everyone it is a great way to think of cancer in another way My father in law has kidney cancer and we are writing things to say to him while hes still alive just like in the book
The Fault in Our Stars was beautifully written  The story kept the reader engaged  The thoughts of young cancer patients and their journey is a subject matter that makes for an outstanding book  Read it
Loved this book  The two main characters  have cancer and their great personalities will make you love them all the more This book is so well written I could not put it down Can't wait to see the movie
It was lovely I did think that some of the language was above an average 16yr olds vocabulary but other than that it was good It sort of reminded me of Dawson's Creek in terms of vocabulary vs character
It was sad happy depressing and uplifting My granddaughter asked me to read it because she was reading it I wasn't sure if I wanted to because it is for young adults but I was wrong It is for everyone
An engaging story  Likeable charcters believeable story lines  Recommend for all ages Statistically I am a senior citizen and I loved it  I  look forward to discussing it with  nieces and nephews
But I think everyone knows that by now  Went to see it on the big screen and glad I had already read most of the book or else I would've been bawling through the whole thing  But lots of humor in it also
This was just made into a movie  I still suggest reading the book and creating your own visual images for this wonderful and poignant story of young love and bravery in the face of challenges  Great book
Honestly I have never read a more touching story that made me cry so much I felt like I was actually with Hazel and Augustus John Green is an amazing author and I am definitely reading more of his books
The end the most important part in anything was perfect Almost like tell the reader it's okay it's okay it's time to let go The end of the book was the death and the reader was life
absolutely the most amazing story line I've read in a long time me and my daughters saw the movie as well it's definitely worth spending money to read and understand the love that these two people possess
This book is for everyone We are all Hazel and Gus We will all die We will all experience the death of a loved one We all have thecapacity to face both things with dignity grace and yes humor
This book was a great story of love and life and for some how it's too short  It leaves you thinking in the end that your life could be much worse and to not take things for granted  Don't be a granade
This was a really good book about cancer kids being in love but it didn't fall into the tour of the stereotypical cancer children book John Green did a remarkable job with this book Highly recommended
I'm only 13 and I might not know a good book when I see one but this is the best book I've ever read in my entire life I highly recommend this book And it's not a chick book either I give it a 100000000
Broke my heart I have my own scar now :) just a thought - it might have been cool to have the book end in an incomplete sentence like an imperial affliction But that's just me :) love love loved it
This was the most amazing love story I have read I'm worried the movie will do it no justice Alas I will watch it but in the privacy of my own home with my Kleenex in hand Well done John Green Well done
Loved the book While the story focused on two teens falling in love they were two very smart intellectual and fun teens - despite their circumstances I've recommended it to friends in other book clubs
This book was beautiful and amazing it was an emotional roller coaster my best friend after I read this book had to sit and comfort me it really hit home because I know many cancer patients who are fighting
This book was better than I thought it would beAs soon as I started I didn't stop until I was done The characters are amazing and john green really does know how to string words together seamlessly
John Green is an amazing writer This is my first novel of his and I look forward to others As for cancer I live that he shows me it's living and trying to live just like our hearts do on a daily basis
Hope they do a good job with the movie  Held my attention even though one of the characters was a bit implausible and the teen-age dialog less than authentic  Just go with it - the story is very touching
This was a good book At it started out slow trying to understand different terms but once you got through it the book was a good and quick read It's a very emotional book so get ready to shed some tears
I am going to tell all my friends to read it because it's the best book ever and I will tell them that I loved it and that not only should they read the book that they should see the movie afterüòÑüòä‚ò∫Ô∏èüòâ
I can't add much to what thousands have written in other reviewsIt worksperiod On every level it works Is it great literature Hell noBut the characters grip you and move youa lot
I didn't like it but maybe it's just because I chose this book only because of other people reviews Usualy I don't read this kind of books and this story didn't come to me interesting in any kind of way
Loved it such a well written book it kept me engaged at all times intelligent writing not easy to find these days not a fairy tale ending but a more realistic and heroic ending I highly recommend it
touching and poignant I had to read it twice An unforgettable story I recommend it to every person who falls in love and who loses a dearly loved one Heartwarming Expertly told like a teenager would
I tend to avoid books about cancer not wanting to be part of the pain This was a great read and although it's fictional introduced me to the reality of cancer and maybe what it could be like to have it
I love everything about this book A pointer though I think it would rouse more if Augustus died out of the blue Other than that this is an amazing book extraordinary beyond words Great job john green
I thought it was a good read I did have a bit of a hard time connecting with the charactersbut I did find it to be a tear jerker HoweverI feel that the movie was better but the book was not bad at all
I just could not put it down I have been reading and plugging away at it Such a great love story that very easily van come to life Everyone who like  love stories should definitely read this I love it
It is a great rests some upsetting moments but very enjoyable However the ending was very abrupt and not very easy to understand they way it was written Will watch the movie soon but would recommend it
Characters were pretty good  Was a little repetitive and chaotic  I liked that it was true to people who are going through an illness and want to do what THEY want to do  The ending was not my favorite
I enjoyed the story and the characters  The author that was visited in the Netherlands had an interesting story which wasn't clearly explained  I wanted to understand him and his assistant a little more
This book reminds me of a modern version of Love Story the  movie with Ryan and AliThe story made me laugh and cry I had heard this was a teen sensation but it is a good read for anyone
This was a read all at once book I did not know it was about cancer It was not whineyor poor me type book It was how real people face cancer I know because my husband is Stage 4 and he is living this
My older teenaged girls loved this book Just a heads up--there is one mature romantic scene between the two main characters who are both about 17 years old I would not recommend this for younger readers
The emotional roller coaster and tenderness laughter will makes this book impossible to put down  quick witted real emotional story  And thought provoking Thanks to author for writing such epic story
I started out not wanting to read a sad book about cancer  I was so pleasantly surprised by how it was written I liked the insightful point of view the author used to write the book  I enjoyed the book
As a cancer survivor (two times) this touched my heart I feel that the book was an honest reality that most books do not convey I loved the humor and the heartbreak of both characters Very well written
this book made me cry so hard the story is beautiful the movie made me cry aswell it's so touching how much they cared for one anther this book really touched me in so many ways thank you John Green
I seriously loved the book I cried i laughed The book made me feel lucky to have the people i have in my life I would read iver and over again if i had to The movie was great too Cried so loud there
I'm crying Damn it The book was amazing I will leave a mark on this world and if I have a say of what it will be it will be a novel half as good as this one That will be enough I can't stop crying :(
i loved this book words cant describe how good of a job mr green did writing this book not to show the life of cancer perks bit show the life of romance which may be broken in a matter of life and death
This book is so much to take in  It is a beautiful tragic story  I recommend this book to anyone from a teen in high school to an elderly person  I will definitely be reading other books by John Green
Saying I enjoyed this book just doesn't quite carry the correct meaning The book is well written and certainly speaks to a teenage heart and mind it is a good book and I look forward to seeing the movie
Great book about a difficult subjectloved the main characters A very good satisfying read I read this book fairly quickly and learned more about what families go thru when a cancer diagnosis happens
I would recommend this book as required reading to everyone The characters are so endearing and I found myself stopping many times to reconsider and/or contemplate my own beliefs about the subject matter
I couldn't put this book down This book has made me look at so many things differently I loved Hazels wit thru the book and fell in love with Augustus Keep the tissues handy can't wait to see the movie
This wasn't your typical love story which is what makes it so great  Such raw feelings an emotions were brought out in this book A must read for anyone who wants to feel love if only for a little while
I had to read the book before seeing the movie and I'm glad I did It was both funny at times and very sad at times I havent cryed so hard reading a book in a long time I wish it had a sequel coming out
I loved this book I had if for a while and after reading it can not imagine why I waited so long to dig into it Great story and was a easy read Loved the authors writing style Defiantly worth the buy
I give this book a five star it is so good it is romantic poeticand many more I cry at the end but this book BLEW my MIND I have never read a book this good EVER if u like ROMANCE books READ THIS BOOK
I did not want to read this book because I did not want to feel depressed  I am so glad I finally read it what I would have missed had I not The characters are wonderful Greatly written Just loved if
This book made me cry it made me laugh it made me want to keep reading I don't think I've read a book this intensely since I was younger The Fault In Our Stars is possibly the best book I've ever read
Wow what a well written novel that truly pulls at your heart throughout the entire journey Tissues are necessary and the emotions felt are raw It's an interesting take on a Romeo and Juliet tragic love
Heartbreakingly beautiful cathartic and lovely with a witty character banter that never disappoints  Oh Augustus and Hazel GraceI'll be thinking about the tragedy of your love story for some time
this was a touching story everyone I know has been affected one way or another by cancer it is the most awful and horrendous illness John green at least found some humor and love that was very touching
wow I have never cried so hard about a book it's amazing an amazing masterpiece this book opened my eyes and my brain (expanding my vocab tremendously) this is by far my favorite book sorry divergent
I bought this book not knowing it was for meant adolescents but even if I'm nor I'm glad I did The theme this books delves into is a human one affecting all ages I really enjoyed the dialogues as well
This book is nothing short of amazing It is laugh out loud funny tragic heartbreaking and so very wise I fell in love with the characters and I could not put it down It is a life-changing experience
I never expected to whizz through this book on 24 hours I couldn't put it down It is truly eye opening and I will remember some of the quotes and themes forever I high recommend you pick this one up :)
I rate my books based on the lesson it leavesand I gladly give this book five stars many lessons are given in this book but there may be that one lesson that gets you thinking mine certainly did anyhow
Loved it It was a great read and a beautiful story I don't think I'll watch the movie because I love the book so much just the way it is and movies have a way of changing things that are just perfect 
Such a great book At one point your laughing and the next your swimming in your own tears By the end of this book I had used up 2 boxes of tissues I love it so much and could read it a thousand times
This book was one of the most saddest and romantic comedy book I have EVER read in my whole entire life If you have seen the movie the book is like a homerun compared to a strike You will LOVE this book
It's always hard to read about people dealing with life threatening diseases It was a sweet story between Hazel and Augustus but these kind of stories never have a fairy tale ending It was well written
it's not everyday that a book can captivate not only the mind but the heart as well I fell in love with the characters and my heart mourned for their loss this is one of the best books I have ever read
Very good and quick read  I knew the movie was coming out on DVD so I wanted to hurry and read it before I watched the movie  I haven't watched the movie yet so I can't compare the movie to the book
A wonderful book and storyline OkayOkayOkay is our always Be prepared to wipe tears from your eyes Very touching I'm sure the movie will not do this book justiceThis is a MUST READ
I was captivated by this book and read it in about 24 hours I have no close companions who have had cancer but now I have a better understanding of what someone with cancer might be thinking and feeling
Good book to relate to in whatever circumstances Couldn't put it down and laughed and cried Haven't seen the movie version yet but I love books that come to film so I can enjoy each version differently
Good story about a love between to young dying kids The story shows you that life never ends just like the unfinished book Make your own ending The characters were believable The story was catching 
I was truly expecting more but the ending was too predictable and it felt as thought the author was just in a hurry to finish the book A quick decent read but would more than likely not read it again
Great book loved the ending which I so understand after reading it It was also filled with clever remarks and I found the book smart if you know what I mean Loved the book great love story for teens
Well written especially given the difficulty writing youthful prose that is believable poses for any author The story itsef is predictable and formulaic in my opinionbut its a good story nonetheless
Cried my eyes out and want to forever remember what these young loves thought of each other and did for each other This is an exquisitely beautiful and painful book and it is a story I will never forget
I didn't think id like this book because it's about young teens But I loved it darn near cried every other page What a wonderful love I hope to have half of what these two did when I find my soulmate
I am one of those people who read it because the movie came out but this book has turned into one my favorite books of all time: full of heart warming and tear filled moments highly recommend this book
Good: clever makes you think about death in a realistic/natural way  made me cry /was sentimental Not great: tried too hard morbid superficial All-in-all not a bad book but it didn't hit the mark
Absolutely love this book I read this book in one day could not put it down It engages you to were you want to read it to see what comes next  Its amazing and now I can not wait to watch the movie
I love this book in the way that it has a sharp way of caressing a reader and bringing it under in a breathless tale of two young lovers in the hopes of a happier life it simply could not get any better
I basically got sucked into the book  The events keep bouncing back and forth between happy and sad  I recommend this book to anyone out there  It's perfect and amazing  It's an enchanting love story
I don't know exactly what I liked about this story It was a great love story and very insightful I hated the fact that Gus diesthat anyone has to dieIt gave me  some wisdom to hang on to
The Fault in Our Stars is a beautiful book it displays love and courageThe courage wouldn't be possible without the love like this fact they depend on each other just like Hazel and Augustus do
What an enlightening book  If you as most of us have been effected by cancer in any capacity this is a MUST READ  A very thought provoking novel that is possibly much more fact rather than fiction
I love this book so much Although it was very heart-wrenching it was the best thing I have ever read I would recommend this book to absolutely anybody This book is without a doubt downright amazing
This is a heart warming book of two people finding the light when life has done nothing but leave them in the dark It paints a picture of not innocent teenagers or kids gone wild but ones who are living
This is by far the best book that I have ever read There was not one thing that I did not like about this book Every aspect of it is pure perfection And the movie definitely does not disappoint either
Really enjoyed the book john green really makes you fall in love with these characters from the beginning he shares the truth of their condition as well and doesn't really make this a fairytale love story
It is well written and quite an enjoyable read from a perspective of a person dealing with terminal cancer which i found very interesting  It was a bit predictable at the end but still a very good read
I love this book I feel the sixteen year old girl rushing in me as I devour each page And I am fifty six The fault lies in my solar plexus right now as I am sorting things out Thank you John Greene
OK this is now one of my favorite movies along with The elephant man  The movie did a better job of delivering so many lines than I delivered them to myself when reading them  Bring tissues
I laughed and I cried (well actually sobbed) I read this book per a recommendation from one of my students and I completed it in one sitting You fall in love with the idea of love despite circumstance
A very touching story it teaches you that in spite of all the obstacles you face in life there's always a bright side  Hold on to the good memories they will bring a smile when you feel it's impossible
The best book I've read in a long time  I knew where it was going but when it got to that point I felt like I'd been hit by a truck  I went through a whole box of tissues but it was worth every second
I loved the book and I don't usually do girly drama As an English teacher I appreciate the language in the book This is a story that will require younger readers to break out the dictionary
This book makes you thankful and appreciative of life at the same time It is refreshing to have teenagers in a book that actually sound like teenagers Great read if you are interested in medical dramas
I wanted to read this before the movie came so I had no idea what to expect This book i s inciteful and really deals with the human side of dying not the diagnosis of a dying person Great perspective
I enjoyed this book even tough the subject matter is heart wrenching I was glad I read it on my Kindle because the vocabulary was over my head and I could look up the meaning of the words I did not know
This book was great from the first word to the last and had great character to it  I certainly enjoyed it  This book had a great message  I really enjoyed this book and I am sure its readers will too
One of the greatest books I've ever read in my life You'll cry of joy and of sadness It is perfection I cried over six times But even though the tears is the best book I've read in a very long time
it was a great easy read it didn't take me long to read but it was adorable and hilarious and brought up all the feelings for me it was ironically a great post breakup read definitely a must need read
A sad yet realistic look at illness The author writes in an easy to read fashion I finished the book in two days as I really wanted to find out what would happen  My son enjoyed the book too He is 16
I loved this book It was so nice to read a book about love without to much mushy gushy stuff I wish I could have a relationship like Agustus and Hazel I recommend this book highly to everyone
The side of the story you never hear Forever engraved into my mind this story will be I really enjoyed it and it made me appreciate this author so much for creating such a wonderful story for the world
Fantastic  Ordinarily I would not read this type of book as I know it is bound to have a sad ending but I found myself up until 3 am reading about Hazel and Gus Not to mention an extraordinary ending
The fault in our stars was an amazingly touching book that makes you realize how short but at the same time how precious life really is I recommend that everyone read this book when you get a chance
Book is amazingly entertaining Especially for someone who has been through cancer themselves it's very enlightening real but yet still reminds you of the good in the world through all the bad/tragedy
My daughter and I read Paper Towns first loved it then moved on to The Fault in Our Stars John Green just has the nack to create great characters fun dialog between them and weaves a wonderful story
I am a very big reader and it is truly hard for me to find a good book but this book is amazing By far the best It was sad But a lot of books have something sad in them there needs to be a part two
This is a hard book to recommend just because of the description of it but trust me it is one of the best books you'll ever read I am so glad that this has been made into a movie I can't wait to see it
This book grips the heart It reminds me of how fortunate some people are to have great health &amp; to count my blessings daily The spirit of the characters was uplifting &amp; heartfelt I'm so glad I read it
I have read all of John green's books now and this one probably made me cry the hardest I would read this book 100000000000000 Times and still love it Definately get this book You won't regret it
This book was full of truth It showed a true love story and a true story of death There is so much deep meaning within the book And the most striking is that there can be authentic happiness in death
I dont read much because I just dont have time anymore But this book I couldn't put down John Green develops the most perfectly ordinary yet wonderful characters that you can relate to It's a must read
Although to have never experienced cancer myself I found this novel to be enchanting and inspirational and no matter how depressing it can be I cannot stop myself from rereading it over and over again
Cuz this bookIs amazing I purchased other books sight unseen by this author based on this book Took me a week to shake this novel Just found out a movie is  coming based on this book Can't wait
There were so many places where I cry-laughed It has been forever since a story has done that to me Well-written hilarious intelligent and achingly honest this is a new favorite for me Just read it
One word best describes this book: Beautiful(Unfortunately I have to add words in order to submit my review so here is my favorite quote: It would be a privilege to have my heart broken by you)
I am currently crying my eyes out for I just finishing this book I have done nothing in the past three hours but read I love this book so much it hurtsI recommend that you read this amazing book
Honestly one of the best books I've read You will not find a cliche or a cookie-cutter ending here The depth and the honesty that the author delves in to is magnificent - buy it buy it buy it Trust me
John Green's book is incredible I don't have a ton of time to read but when I do I read his novels Love it It is the first novel I've read with someone who has cancer where the book isn't about cancer
John Green has brutally damaged me it's like we're being punished for reading his own book nonetheless this is one story that will stay with me until I die I loved this book very much it has changed me
This is a cute book with cute characters with an interesting plot  this is not what you would call great literature but the story is cute and the characters are likable Easy to read and it goes quickly
I chose this book because of the movie coming out and also because I heard about this girl who read this book and couldn't stop crying I read very frequently and in my opinion this book was not a page-turner highly interesting or wonderfully sad like I thought it would be Since there are many peculiar words used in almost every other sentence this book did not flow easily It is an ok love story but nothing spectacular I'm hoping the movie is better then the book but that just goes to show you how bad the book is when the movie has a definite chance of exceeding I wouldn't recommend this book to anyone it's just very dull
I liked this book a great deal I'll include some mild SPOILERS below - nothing specific but just to give some detail on the story I'll tell you what it's aboutThis book deals with terminal illness first love child/parent relationships and disappointment  It was an engrossing book that I read quickly  I was not 100% satisfied with the ending but it was pretty close  I thought I had figured out where it was going a few times and while I was correct about some elements I was wrong about others  Overall for popular fiction it was much better than averageThe book raised some interesting issues and the author developed some really good characters  I was thoroughly into it while reading and kept thinking about them when I was done  There were a few little moments that raised an eyebrow for me but overall - it all hung together well  As an aside reading the FAQs on the authors website was somewhat disappointing - I did so after finishing the book and kinda wished I hadn'tAll in all - this is not exactly a new classic but it is a really good read  I'm giving it 5 stars in the category of popular fiction
John Green made a MASTERPIECE I was completely captivated At times I wanted to put it away and never finish it But this book is too good for that It involves pain AND joy and it's the best book I've ever readThe Fault in Our Stars is about a teenage girl with terminal cancer The tumors' progress has been stopped with an experimental drug but that only gives her a little more time This girl Hazel Grace meets a boy Augustus WatersLook let me just say it: He was hot A nonhot boy stares at you relentlessly and it is at best awkward and at worst a form of assault But a hot boywellAugustus had cancer and now has a prosthetic leg Augustus is perfect (okay to me) He refuses to stop loving Hazel even though the end is not too far away This is more than the typical love story There's a plot twist you won't ever see coming The book was super sweet and super sad I can't wait to reread it though the first experience is the best YOU NEED TO READ THIS BOOKPS Sorry I've made it sound very depressing But the book is definitely worth it and I'm sorry if I've done it injustice and made it seem too gloomy
Unfortunately I can't attach one so just picture me normally an emotionless robot of a man with rivers of tears running down my face while choking back sobs This book opens you up in such a good way
I was pleasantly surprised how much I enjoyed reading this book  The subject matter is hard for everyone but reading how those who have a life ending disease deal with everyday things was enlightening
It's a nice story where two young hearts who struggle with cancer have the opportunity to fall in love and have that experience of love It ends rather abruptly and left some unanswered questions though
some beautiful quotes and revelations inside a teenage drama sadly the author is accurate as far as I'm concerned about loved ones that are left behind and the emotional upheaval in the wake of a loss
It isn't very often that a book keeps me from getting much needed sleep however this book is definitely one of them I can only hope that the movie is as good as the book I highly recommend this book
This book is such an amazing book it brought so much emotion into me it made me smile laugh and defiantly cry:( this will forever be my favorite book I wish I could forget it all and retread it agian
This book was very well written Though it was supposed to be from a Teens point of view of life with cancer it stated everything's my adults would say Would recommend for anyone except hypochondriacs
Not your regular cancer story Hazel has cancer This is her story I was taken on a journey along with Hazel I loved being able to meet the characters in this book Get out the tissues and read it too
I liked the story and can see why teens are devouring this book For an adult its an easy read but one that takes you back to your first love despite the illness of the characters Or maybe in spite of
Really a fantastic book  It's a quick read too which is a plus  Read it in like 3 days  I was glad I decided to give into thy hype and pick it up Loved the characters and John Green's writing is fab
As I enter into this weekend of fundraising for cancer reading this book could not have come at a more appropriate time WOW Cancer sucks If you do not cry reading this booki fear for your heart
This is my new favourite book  I can't believe it's written for young adult  It's touching believable sweet and tragic  Love it love it love it  I would not go see the movie and ruin it for myself
It was an amazing detailed story  It opens up your eyes  and makes you not take anything for granted  I honestly couldn't stop crying  I even got a headache  but all in all  It's an amazing book
Deliciously sad  Green expertly forces the reader to examine large questions I finished the entire thing in one day and smiled like an emo teenager listening to the shins for the first time Beautiful
Consider this a book that might make my own spoiled nagging children appreciate life more without continually wanting more material things  Loved the characters ability to keep taking on life each day
I am not usually a book reader butI could  not put this one down  Every chapter even though sad was gripping  It was like I was inside Hazel Graces head living with her and her thoughtsThank you
It's a startlingly amazing book that has hardly any truth to it but still cuts deeper than any real thing could I couldn't stop laughing and crying at the same time Like AIA to Hazel this was to me
Loved the storyline just ended abruptly (sort of expected that though) and with all the hype it's gotten I supposed I expected to be wow'd buy it though I wasn't Was still really good regardless
Very sad We don't think of terminal cancer kids having real life issuesI had cancer and I have to thank the author for not writing a lot about hospital time and how it takes over your life Great book
This has been the best book I've ever read Its  so breath taking and refreshing Very Lovelyand i didn't want it to endive officially fallen in love with a booknow i must see the movie :-D
Great story that makes you think much harder about life and death The difference pain and real pain The difference between love and true love How much time do we each have and how we want to spend it
great story I have cancer and it really touched my heart this story about half way through tears and sadness wish it had a happy ending but like real life sometimes the stars product differently
Loved it Read this book in two days I wasn't expecting to get so wrapped up in the characters and care about them as much as I did I read this before going watch the movie Hope it doesn't disappoint
This was a poignant story about a sensitive subject; cancer At a tender age the teens in this story teach us a lesson that probably takes many people a lot longer to learn One of my all time favorites
Tragic in that they never got to grow older  Their love will be frozen in time Beautiful and lovely that they found each other  If one person gets you in a life then you have left your mark
So sad and very emotional but its that novel that you could just read over and over I recommend to ANYONE who cares and has a heart that is able to care for the fictional or real Happy reading readers
Great book  Very thought provoking  Enjoyed getting to know all of the characters and their courage in living life while facing death each day  Would highly recommend it to everyone over age thirteen
I swear once I started I couldn't stop This book is literally one of the best books in my life I love how unique this book is everything about it Once you start you'll get pulled in It's beautiful
What great and easy read  I figured out the plot at the beginning but Green is engaging and his characters have such wit that it was easy to keep going to see how they dealt with the lives before them
This is an epic love story written as it pours from your very own heart I found it sad but unable to put it down Life is precious the author tells you exactly why through the love and loss of life
This book made me cry and laugh at the same time Truly beautiful and contained amazing word choice I would recommend this book to anyone into two teenagers falling in love in a beautiful way So good
I really enjoyed this book  It is well written and a quick read  I enjoyed the story very much it makes you realize how you can find good in life even when you have struggles and life just isn't fair
Wonderfully bittersweet life story None of us knows how many days we have been given to live our lives Some of us live a lifetime in a shorter lifespan so cherish every moment as if it were your last
I loved the dialogue between Hazel and Gus  It was so honest  This book made me wonder a lot if people who are terminal really have this different way of perceiving things or the outlook like they had
I read it all in one day I haven't read a book in one day since harry potter I laughed equally as much as I cried I started crying in chapter 8 and didn't really stop Beautiful absolutely beautiful
It just makes you appreciate the little things around you Also you understand that love is such a beautiful thing that can make life worthwhile even if it is for small periodHighly recommend it
I read this book in 2 sittings I loved Augustus and his love for Hazel This story never slowed down never dulled always eye-widening or snicker-inducing Just read it Can't wait for the mooovie
This book is an epic love story I fell in love over and over again with this story It takes me a special book that i can stay into and i cant find any books like that but this book its outstanding
Green brings to life the real experience and thoughts of those who face their mortality everyday This is a book that should be passed on from generation to generation A refreshing voice amongst voices
Great book Had me both laughing &amp; crying in the same chapters Such a beautiful story of love &amp; triumph I loved the characters &amp; their courage &amp; strength Can't wait to see the movie 5 plus stars
I thought this book was amazing I don't read often because I find that I don't like books that don't seem real But I felt like I was living Hazel Graces life This is one I'll read many more times
This book was amazing I absolutely love how the ending is very dramatic (I won't give spoilers) I appreciate how realistic the characters were I'm looking forward to reading John Green's other novels
The ending ruined it-blah  I guess the ending had to be similar to An imperial Affliction  What happens to Hazel  When  Do her parents survive it  Does her mom become another Patrick Unsatisfied
I loved this bookI couldn't put it downI really recommend reading itit does cuss a bit and there is one part that gets a pretty inappropriate its a pg13 bookbut it's amazing
I have never felt such strong emotions while reading a book before I laughed sobbed hoped and mourned with these characters It really put my own life into perspective I strongly recommend this book
I shall remember this book for the rest of my days  I must have used two entire boxes of Kleenex to wipe my eyesand nose while crying through this book  Makes me want to read more by this author
Honestly this was the best book I have ever read It's an inspirational story of loss and love I'm overly excited for the movie but have a feeling nothing could beat the wonderful book I have just read
I loved this book and I literally cried 3 times I recommend this book and I chose it because EVERYONE was likeYOU HAVE TO READ IT and I did and it was the best book and my favorite one by far
I legitimately read this book in less than a day and I am a 12 year old boy that hates reading I can't fathom the work that was put into the simplest words in this breath taking book Simply incredible
beautiful this book is beautiful i finished it in one day (the fastest i've ever read a book) and all through the next school day i was saying  THE FEEELLZZZZ to everyone i saw its just that good
Great message and a different perspective on life Really good vocabulary and descriptions You might need the tissue box handy while reading this though The movie is coming out on June 6 2014 #tfios
I am 31 years old and this is one of my favorite books of all time I gave out copies for Christmas to friends and family No matter your age there is much to be learned about life by reading its words
I loved the fact that it made me want to laugh and cry at the same time It's very rare that reading a book would make me want to shed a tear but The Fault In our Stars definitely accomplished that task
This is so inspirational and I loved it It made me feel like I was Hazel and I literally cried I LOVED IT SO MUCH John Green is a gifted writer and I love his books I recommend this book to EVERYONE
This book is very touching very well written that is easy to read I enjoyed reading it a lot and seriously could't get my hands off of it until i was done John green is one of me favorite authors now
Really enjoyed reading this book Connected to the characters right away and experienced a wave of emotions while reading Love that it's not a downer book like it could have been despite the sad topic
I loved this book because it made me laugh and made me sad he did a great job of portraying such a beautiful story about a touchy subject it is a love story of no other and you will love this book too
Oh my this book It breaks your heart and feels so real I work with the sick and dying It was refreshing to read about someone real someone who wasn't just trying to fight and smile I just loved it
What an excellent book she thought as she sobbed into her burrito at ChipotleSeriously though SUCH a good book I just don't recommend reading it in public because you WILL cry
I'm not see I can put into words how simply wonderful this story is  Separating itself from others in the YA genre The Fault in Our Stars will go down as one of the best Ever written  Bravo John Green
This book truly is beautiful full of philosophical wisdom and characters that you want to meet I wish I could write as well as the author if only for the sake of leaving a proper commendation 5 stars
This is well written book that makes you think what is the mark you will leave  I would recommend you have some tissues and have some time to sit and read You will fall in love with the characters
I love John Greens work It's easy to understand and the way he describes things is just so perfect You can feel the emotions and see what he wants you to see in your head without rambling descriptions
Honestly this was for a summer assignment for my literature class but I read it in two afternoons I actually cried after reading this It's a great book a quick read and definitely paying the price for
Wonderful book I really enjoyed spending time with the lovely sweet sad witty and relatable collection of characters The story lingered with me and the end was just excusitely sad clever and real
Poetic and tangled this story of two teens looking over the edge of their lives is both heartbreaking and provoking Not exactly realistic characters but ultimately it's a good book with a few faults
I love it I watched the movie and read the book they both make me want to cry I think this book  is beautifully written and is very specific with its detail if you think this was sad Watch the movie
Tragic story of two young people with terminal cancer meet at a support group and form a lasting relationship Tells how they accept their illness and live life to the fullest Leaves a lasting impact
This is a wonderful story about teenagers who have medical conditions (no spoilers here) and the way they interact and grow to depend on each other  It's a true to life story with a movie in the works
My 13 year old absolutely loved the book It usually takes her a while to read something but she did not want to put ot down She said a lot of crying moments where you can visualize what it looks like
Emotionally gripping The first time in a long time actual tears fell as I read the pages This book takes you on an emotional roller coaster that forces you to examine how you are living your own life
A brilliantly written book which explores relationships and feelings on so many levels  Ultimately a story of life and how we live  I especially enjoyed the relationship between Hazel and her parents
It started out slow but finally picked up around Chapter 3 or so The ending surprised and confused me at the same time I have not seen the movie version yet but I hope it is as exciting as the book
This book is very well written catering to younger audiences without alienating older readers A heart-tugging story of young love it is a book I would recommend to any fan of drama or romance novels
I love books that I am still thinking about weeks later  This falls firmly in that category  Even my husband liked it and he is a manly man  The movie is well done but as per norm book is better
So real  Enjoyed the book and the moviealmost glad they were not identical  Each offered different ways to think the thoughts that come naturally from book and movie  Definitely thought provoking
I LOVE THIS BOOK SO MUCH I wouldn't recommend ANY other book It's sad sad sad hillarious romantic and makes you think about things from a completely different angle  I LOVED IT
This book goes right to your heart whether you are a parent or s sibling  These illnesses have probably touched everyone at one time or another  I read this book at the recommendation of my daughter
The Fault in Our Stars was absolutely amazing It made me cry like a baby The book is definitely a page turner and worth reading; the story is both beautiful and sad John Green did an amazing job
This is a beautiful story of two young people who treat their cancer as a part of their life  They live as though it is just something to deal with not to pity them because of it  It is a great read
I did think It was a chick flick but it is not It opens it eyes to earth To the real l world Where life isn't a fantasy This opens the hearts of many Recommended 4 all (Note:some tricky words)
I loved this story It was so sad but I loved how it played out You can feel how hard it is not to cry I was crying the entire time And I loved the movie and actors that played in it It was amazing
Amazing book Absolutely a tear jerker Definitely worth the read Loved this book I'm 25 and thought this book was amazing my younger sister also read and enjoyed Good read for all ages teen &amp; up
I've never read a book that has touch me like this It makes you appreciate the things you have and to enjoy life This book is not just a story but a experience Just a FYI you are going to cry a lot
TFIOS is officially my all time favorite book The book was life changing It will make you you laugh and cry in the same breath It will make you cherish and value both life and death in its entirety
This book had me laughing crying memorized loving every character Truly an amazing book I would recommend to anyone This is now one of my favorite books Looking for more titles by this author
this is a book for all ages it may be sad but it is also a beautiful love story the characters are beautifully written strong and intelligent in the middle of all the illness their love stands out
This book was so wonderful I absolutely loved it John Green is an amazing writer I felt connected to the characters I immediately downloaded the rest of his books after reading this one So perfect
I loved this book it made me cry but a very good book to read I finished this book in 2 days cuz It was so addicting to read I loved it n I'm going to watch the movie Friday yea u should read This book
It was a good read  Could not put it downI work with sick and hurting people and I felt the author presented the characters realistically  I doubt the movie could give ti justice my thanks to him
a great book very enjoyable  especially for teens  the idea of holding on to something beautifu in life while batteling a fatal ailment is amaing an outstnding book full of love love and love &lt;3
It's the FAULT IN OUR FREAKING STARS If you kind reader need /another/ review than you've officially spent more time reading reviews that could've been spent reading this book Buy it; love it Done
I wish everyone could read this book  I became emotionally attached to the characters and the book caused me so much joy but also sadness bc it touched me  If your thinking about reading it please do
The book was awesome Hazel reminds me a lot of my best friend Actually their personalities resemble each other so much it's scary But anyways it was a great book but I wish the ending wasn't so sad
I knew that this was a book about cancer and a friend said it was heart-wrenching but I wanted to read it before the movie came out Its a very well written book and I'd recommend it to all my friends
this book is the best book I have read in years  I completed reading the entire book in 2 days  I have heard there is a movie about to be released but I don't know anything about the cast or location
I like the characters  They have real qualities and the author keeps your attention with a dry-witted intellectual humor I like the title of the book and after reading it fin it to be very befitting
This I believe was the best book of my entire life I recommend it to anyone and everyone It was an overall amazing lifechanging book It changed my point of view on life and so much more I loved it
I began reading this book because my 12 year old daughter wanted to see the movie and we thought it best yo read the book first  We no longer have any interest in the movie  What a disappointing read
When we only read to analyze we rob ourselves of experiencing the raw emotions a story can stir within Green shows us that with great pain comes the strength to feel the scars human life leaves behind
I loved the romantic scenes the humorous lines some amazing quotes on every chapter I bookmarked and highlighted in many colors that their are almost 90 notes I noted in the whole book all 313 pages
Just an amazing story all together I cried I rejoiced and then I cried again I'm still so effected by it the characters and the dialogue are so profound Officially one of my top 10 favorite books
Effortless read that made me cry  I love any book that has the power to make me cry I wish that teenagers really spoke this way like they are all from Dawson's Creek  But a great story nonetheless
Loved this book  Beautiful love story and very well written  While the target audience is young adults I think it appeals to a broader audience  By far it's the best novel I've read from this author
This is one of those stories that you read that sticks with you  I wasn't able to pick up another book for several days after reading this (which is NOT my normal response at all)  So glad I read it
I thought this was a lovely little book I really enjoyed the characters and the relationships which developed I especially enjoyed the sense of humour which persisted despite the tragic circumstances
It was beautifully written The story managed to have serious moments mixed in with humor And it was definitely not a typical story but one that definitely moves you and sticks with you after reading
The book is a really easy read and was very enjoyable I rated it a 4 merely because it's probably written for someone younger (probably high school) to read That being said it was a good quick read
This book is a sad yet refreshing story that I could read again and again Being a teenager that doesn't have much time to read it was one I made time for and one of my all time favorites hands down
I think that everyone should read this bookI can't  say that this book was at all happy for which I will be depressed for days to come I absolutely believe that this book should be read by everyone
This book is so well written - I didn't want it to end- and then when it did I started reading it again - Hazel and Gus made me go through so many emotions thru their storyI can't wait for the movie
I've known about John Green for years but never got the chance to read his books  This is his most recent book but is the first one I ever read and I'm glad I pick this one first  Recommend it highly
Nothing hold can stay Everything is an infinity yet some are more than others This book is amazing and made me cry but yet I didn't care bc it was beautiful But as you'll see nothing gold can stay
Beautifully written emotionally draining happy and sad with a real message You'll laugh you'll cry but you probably won't hurl unless you really can't handle a description of a G-tube coming out
Couldn't put the book downloved it At first I wasn't sure where it was going but the author did a fantastic job of keeping you interested I don't cry but I may have shed a tear while reading this
I loved the book from the very first page to the last I couldn't put it down  Wonderfully written  A emotional rollercoaster Filled with both laughs and tears A must read book Over and over again
It was such a good book the only thing I didn't like was how they kept using words from other books and stuff But really i've been crying and eating after finding out (SPOILER ALERT) Augustus dies :(
This book is the best book I've ever read It certainly makes me look at things quite differently than I had before I'll probably read this book many times and still never cease to absolutely adore it
would give it 35 - readable work about 2 young people battling cancer and figuring out what to do with love that probably doesnt have a chance in hell to last  characters are clever somewhat heroic
I really liked it pieces of reality fill up those last few pages There are no fairytale endings no forever infinities but what we can do is try to remember those little infinities while they lasted
This book is simply amazing I watch John Green's vlogbrothers on YouTube and his voice perfectly reflects his personality and is incredible how easy it is to understand yet widens my vocabulary DFTBA
A wonderful book with great characters that you want to follow until the end  Expect to read the book in one sitting as you will not be able to put it down and expect to cry a lot but also laugh a lot
I cried throughout this entire novel Simply a beautiful story about the purity of love and the finality of life It will make you realize what is important in life and have you hugging your loved ones
This book was so beautifully written It made me laugh hard and cry deeply It was so powerful and deeply moving and thought out I highly recommend it I finished it days ago and it has stayed with me
John Green you sir know how to write Plain and simple This happened to be my first venture into a John Green novel and no sooner did I wipe away the tears of the this book did I download his full anthology This book had everything I look for in a YA novel or any book for that matter The characters were real for me Mr Green develops his characters extremely well and the reader genuinely cares for what happens to them The plot moves quickly and is effortlessly paced As you probably know the novel is at its core about two cancer patients who fall in love But for me the book became so much more than that I don't want to give anything away but I really took the book's message to heart I have not read a book that has affected me like this one has in a very long time As I referenced earlier I am not afraid to admit that this book drew a few tears from me by the turn of the last page I enjoyed every minute of this book and I have heard the same from everyone that I have recommended it to Please read this book You will not regret that you did I am not sure I will ever be able to forget StarsStay Classy Amazon
The story was intense--about young people with cancer  I have a son battling leukemia--so I could empathize--  But the young people had some funny and light moments along with a very serious illness
this book has made me cry laugh and even infuriate I love the story and the characters as if they were real and this book has really changed me as a person Keep on writing amazing books John Green
Everyone has their time and everyone is called to heaven  This book makes you think about what we choose to do in our precious time here  Who is important to you and what would you do with that time
This is a very easy read It is heart wrenching in many places However in its simplicity and yet complexity of the the way life &amp; death are explained by the main characters it is simply put beautiful
Exceptional book with so much heart I fell in love with the characters and felt their authenticity and raw emotion with all my heart John Green is a superb writer I can't wait to see the movie now
Simply beautiful The writing style was sophisticated and yet down to earth Accessible to any audience young or old Certainly makes you appreciate the ones you love Can't wait to see the movie now
I Love this Book it really shows the truth that not all stories end in a happily ever after because they can't So many amazing points and it is filled with humor and tragedy that makes your head spin
Not done  I had a niece that went though a debilitating disease and died before the age of 13  She always said the one thing she would miss is not being able to dance with a boy  Lovely book so far
Late in the spring of my 13th year i read The Fault In Our Stars it was amazing and loved it so much i the movie was great too this book will make you cry and i did Read this book if you want to cry
This book is so friggin awesome &amp; funny &amp; sad &amp; everything u want in a book and ive read ALOT of books in my 12yr lifetime more than alot of adults in THIER lifetime and this one is definently up there
Beautifully written book Not suitable for reading on the train though because it is quite the tearjerker I loved the story and perspective and read it in about 3 days because I couldn't put it down
Best book ever It's so thoughtful and it tells you don't always win There's so many life lessons in it and the best love story possible It never holds back emotions I'm in love with the book
Usually avoid this theme Grateful I did not Powerful and positive and meaningful reminder of so much that is great and good about life Also surprisingly adorable and even funny at times Loved it
I absolutely love this book It is so much better than the movie I was disappointed with the movie because they left out so many good parts of the book The book was one of the best books I have read
Fantastic read  Insightful and poignant  Beautiful romance that brings the sadder points of life into view Realistic view of the desires of sick children who just want to be seem as normal
A sweet story without being cloying  Easy to read  Easy to love the characters  My teenage niece and nephew loved it and I can see that it speaks in their voice and appeals to their fears and hopes
I loved this book I would recommend this book to everyone It has a huge amount of true love a bit of action and a ton of sadness and drama Please please please read this book I Am BEGGING  You
This book was recommended to me and so glad I read this It is a book that once you start you just can't stop reading it henceforth it took me less than a day to read Great book well worth the price
This book had deep journey through the lives of two people unquestionably in love It was funny and flirtatious one moment and emotionally riveting the next John green really did good with this one
As a former nurse I have been through many end of life experiences so this book ran rang true to me The love story was perfect proof that love can happen to the young old sick--it's always a gift
the best book ever you get so attached the characters are so themselves and have their own personality not some made up fake thing they were like real people recommend this book to anyone amazing
Loved the book it was one of the few books that I have ever read that I didn't find to have grammatical or spelling errors  Great twists to the story unexpected ending  Loved it  Read it in a day
This book drew me in from page one I didn't want to put it down Reminds me much of life in how unpredictable every day will be I have defiantly advised my friends to read this page turner Loved it
Was not what I was expecting it was funny serious sad and so much more  The only thing that I wasn't fond of was the ending came out of nowhere and I was wanting more But this was not a bad thing
this book was greatly detailed and made me feel everything that all the characters went through Although I cried really hard at this book I have to say that I loved it and it is a great book to read
The Fault in Our Stars caught me and pulled me in right away  An easy and fast read I couldn't seem to read the story of two young lovers who HAPPEN to be cancer patients quickly enough  Excellent
This book has utterly ripped my heart apart and pieced it back together in a way that I cannot even fathom Such a depressing story yet the love that's intertwined makes it's happiness shine through
This book was amazing it made me cry but I loved it is much and it made me think that a lot of people are lucky in this world and that no matter who you are  you will find your love forever and always
Picked this book since the movie is coming out I thought it was a quick weekend read and I really enjoyed it Funny and sad leaves you thinking about life and death and how we spend the time we have
I almost didn't read this because it is classified as young adult fiction It is very moving I recommend it to everyone but especially to anyone who has cancer or loves someone with cancer
I was hesitant at the beginning but I fell in love with the characters relationship not too long after It is definitely a teat jerker but I feel like my life has been touched by this phenomenal read
Few books take on the view of a teenager who has been diagnosed with an incurable disease and the challenges they faceknowing they are going to die This book is a must read for teens and adults
I laughed and cried more than twice John green made me fall in love with Augustus and Hazel and Hazel's mom and dad I am definitely going to buy the film so I can cry and cry of both sadness and joy
This book was absolutely incredible I have never felt so connected to a book I laughed and cried my eyes out the whole way through Not only was it full of emotion but the actual writing was stunning
Loved the story from start to finish It is engrossing leaves you thinking and wanting more Can't wait to see the movie although like most it will not come close to the literary version Great st
This book is the best out of all I read I chose 5 stars because that's just how good it is It would be funny if it was called The Fault In Our 5 Stars Augustus needed her so did she I Do I Do
No words can describe how incredible this book was In my own opinion I believe that this is the best book I've ever read If you haven't read this book yet; please do so You WILL NOT be disappointed
This book had just enough excitement and wonder without all the gore that Hunger Games had Not only that but this is the best literal and humorous book I have ever read I recommend this to ages 12+
This book was a good easy read However I feel like everyone built it up so much that I was expecting something extraordinary and it wasn't Not a bad book by any means; but not a great book either
Loved this book particularly as it is set in my home town of Indianapolis  We will be using if for our April book club discussion  I am sure there will be some great questions and discussion/reviews
Honestly the book is heartfelt and purely beautiful Then the end leaves in a state of longing with what happens next Although I believe it is best for the book to end so I can get a good night's rest
John Green has a way of engaging his readers with a cast of young characters facing life and death  A true love story combined with spiritualism make this book suitable for teenagers and adults alike
This book was amazing It brought me to literal tears It was totally worth my 8$ it ended but i will always rememberI'm on  a roller coaster that only goes up my friend - agustus waters
I am justI had to finish reading this book tonight I laughed and cried what a great story of course the author left me wanting morejust like the book the characters loved in this story
This book brought tears to my eyes it's not a book that ends with a happily ever after Insteadthis book taught that no matter how worthless you think you are you made a difference in someone's life
I knew it would be sad but I had no idea it would make me cry that much I felt like I knew the kids and was as involved in their lives as they were Amazing characters Amazing writing Amazing story
I could not put this book down  The characters and the story drew me in quickly and held my attention through out  I felt like I knew these kids and their families  Loved it  I would read it again
This is a very special book Sensitive quirky genuine While it is suggested as a young adult novel it has meaning for anyone who cares about the human condition in all it's manifestations Read it
I highly recommend this book to anyone BUT have your tissues ready The book has very happy times and also some sad times I like that it is written with honesty about cancer but also with some humor
Most books can trap you in their pages for an hour or a day but when you are done the hold they had on you is released Not this book This book grabs ahold of you and will change your way of thinking
Then you have no soul Seriously A book about love loss anticipation disappointment and the impact you can have on others Some may write it off as a cancer book but it is so much more than that
I personally found John Green's novel to be well-written and beautiful with its contemplative tone However I did find it to be overly sappy and occasionally it was also disappointingly predictable
This book was an amazing book It was very inspirational and it brought me to tears I recommended it to my friend and there already starting to read it John Green has some major talent in writing :D
Loved it  This was an excellent book that I think a lot of people should read  John Green does an amazing job of capturing the uncertainty of illness along with the hope and challenges of young love
This book warms your heart with the happiness and knowledge that true love exists and then crushes it at the same time as you read about cancer riddled children Read in one day; could not put it down
I've just reread The Fault in Our Stars and found it to be a perfect book Hazel Grace and Augustus Waters live with the reader after the book is done This YA book is not just for a teenage audience
Don't read the last part of this book in public unless you like openly weeping in front of strangers It's nearly equal parts funny sweet cynical and heartbreaking A great read for teens and adults
This book was well written and a nice quick read John Green does a nice job portraying the characters with cancer--pretty realistic but not too medical or depressing that it is consistently engaging
I literally finished this book less than a minute ago and am now rushing to write this reviewWhen I first heard of this book I thought Here's another writer who's going to write about cancer so that even if the book sucks people will say they love it because they lost someone to cancer I was dead wrongThis book is about Hazel a teenage girl with cancer that has left her hooked to an oxygen tube for the rest of her life however long that may be While attending a support group that she hates Hazel meets another teenager named Augustus Waters who changes her worldThe story revolves around their relationship with one another and a book that Hazel introduces Augustus to a book that takes them halfway across the world for answersI don't think it's possible to finish this book with a dry eye but it's worth shedding a few tears to finish this John Green is my new hero for writing this book he really delved inside of his characters and what it is to be a teenager dying from cancer I have to finish writing this review now so that I can call my mom and tell her to read this book too
I started reading this book not knowing what it was going to be about and no real expectations other than others had said it was good I really didn't know what to expect But I was pleasantly surprised at the book It is now one of my favorites of all-timeBooks have always seemed to make me cry more than movies do For me people get way more emotional invested into books than movies because you get to see the thoughts behind their actions and not just their actions (at least in most books) This book was no exception  The last few chapters I couldn't get through without an onslaught of tears So if you're thinking of reading that in school don't I made the mistake of reading an intense book during school and it was almost a disaster Unless you're okay with people seeing you cry over book then go right aheadI've read some cancer books before this one and they weren't really up to par with this one I may be reading the wrong books but that's life I had tried to read Before I Die by Jenny Downham but I just couldn't get into it like I did with this oneTo wrap all of that up read the book It's very good:)
This was just ok for meOk don't get me wrong I'm not heartless or anything Yes this book did make me cry and the tears flowed at all the right parts of the book that it should haveCancer SUCKS It really doesIt's just thatI didn't LIKE the characters of this book I think that I just couldn't relate to them I wanted to really I did Just so much happened to these kids at such a young age they will miss their whole lives not experiencing things not living life but yetthey seem so wise Clich√© I knowBottom line: I think there was so much hype around this book because of the subject matter A kid with cancer meets more kids with cancer and bond because everyone is dying It's kind of a hard subject matter to go through; the emotional rollercoaster of watching someone you love slowly die and then being that same person who is dying watching your loved ones watch you wither away It's a hard touchy subject Kudos to John Green but like I said this book was just ok for me I just feel like this was done before in every OTHER book about cancer It just felt trite to me
This story was sweet romantic and the first book out of  over 100 that made me cry And I loved that it really show how life is and that you have to enjoy the time you have with the people you love
Cryingbut this book is worth every tear and ounce of pain Comical devastating and honest The Fault in Our Stars has forever marked my soul and slashed then stitched my bleeding heart
A difficult book to recommend if you can take the subject-teenage cancer- as comfortably as they do this is a great readIt sounds corny 2 cancer patients falling in love but it is never that
LOVE THIS BOOK I'm actually reading it more than once Its written is such an intelligent way you actually feel smarter for having read it It's not just a book for kids adults can enjoy this too
This book paints you a vivid picture of what it means to be diagnosed with cancer especially at a young age Love the humorous way in which the author drives home the essence of each characters life
I have no words Just read it Heartbreaking beautiful Mr Green has such a relatable personal voice that shines through the book making it hard to put down despite the pain you'll feel reading it
Love the book Easy to follow and had a few words that I needed to look up the meaning to (expanded my vocabulary) I did notice a couple of typo's but they were not major enough to devalue the point
I finished this book in 24 hours It grabbed me right away from the first chapter the sarcastic wit and black humor of teenagers and left me crying by the end Of course it did But it was worth it
Best book I have ever read honestly Everyone should read this book Then of course go see the movie I love TFIOS so much I swear I'm going to read to over and over again for the rest of my life
I loved the book if you are buying for a pre-teen I suggest you pre- read and make sure that the content is something you want them to read  Decision was made in out home that this isn't appropriate
This book made me appreciate those small tokens of life and love The characters were inspiring and so honest I lived along with them for the time it took to read this book I will never forget them
This was a wonderful story showing how a person should appreciate their family and friends in this life We should realize what kind of impact we can  make  The good and the bad We all grow from it
I'm a little biased since I'm a peds hem/onc nurse I loved the story and perspective of the characters Writing is definitely for teens/young adult if you could get past that then it's a good read
I know this is a beloved book and I actually do love John Green as a vlogger but I found the novel pretentious and tiring  I didn't get very far in before I decided life was too short to finish it
I enjoyed reading this book  It flows along well; easy reading  Only thing I didn't like was ending  I won't elaborate in case someone hasn't read it or is reading  Perhaps there will be a sequel
I loved the way this started out so spunky so witty and how it maintained both all the way through  I fell in love with the characters in such a short space of time What a great book  A must read
tear jerking and a beautiful story of young but mature love; read this in 2 days because I couldn't put it down Beautifully written and was both intellectually and emotionally crafted with excellence
I was disappointed by the very high ratings this book has received I imagine those ratings came from young adults as it clearly written for that genre  It's a nice story but doesn't have much depth
This book is very well written  The topic of death is a difficult subject but it is real for all of use  I liked cancer perks and the ability of the characters to express their  fears  A must read
Over all I enjoyed this book It was intelligently written and I enjoyed the central  characters interactions and relationships I personally found the story to be predictable but overall a good read
While parts of this book were entertaining it seemed to go in circles and was not what I expected There were no parts that stood out to me as exceptional and I read a lot A bit of a disappointment
Although slightly different I highly recommend seeing the movie after reading this Phenomenal acting This book is inspirational and makes you realize how the little things in life really do matter
This book is must read Please don't disregard because you think its a young adult book This book has a great twist and has a surprise ending It sure didn't end the way I thought it would
One of the best books I've read in a long time  I like to have a book to read during my daughter's middle of the night feedings It was so good I stayed up long after she was thru just to finish :-)
Everyone always said that I have to read this book but I thought I would just wait until the movie comes out but I read the book and I've never cried about a book so much It's such an amazing story
I read this just prior to the 1st Father's Day without my DadIt was honest bittersweet and revealing It is a beautifully written book that will speak to each of its readers in its own unique way
A fantastic book to get lost in the intricacies of the human psychie  How insightful some can be and oblivious others are Sad for me having lost a child but makes me happy he also made his mark
I'm a little late to read this but wanted to finish it before I saw the movie Thoroughly enjoyed it and now I can't wait to see it on the screen  I was reading it in the plane and cried like a baby
Some of the best tears I've cried Made my heart hurt but was touching and eye opening to the fact that we should appreciate life and all the amazing details it offers Not everyone gets that chance
Not many books can make you cry  But I won't lie I cried like a baby many times while reading this book  This is not s typical love storyit's even better  It's a realistic love story  Bravo
In anticipation of the movie and after my 13-yr old's rave reviews I decided to read this book  It was fantastic and beautiful and so innocent  I haven't felt this way about a book in soooo long
I loved this book it did take me a few times of reading it to get me into it but once I did I could not put it down  I usually will not take the time to write a review but this book it so worth it
I finished this book a couple days ago and I cannot stop thinking about it The book is wonderfully written and I caught myself laughing out loud at times Thank you for telling this story John Green
This book was amazing I loved every minute of it I have read this book five times so far and I cry every time I do I just wish that it had a happy ending to hazel and Augustus' infinite love story
This is a great book about a girl and a boy who have different types of cancer who fall in love it's amazing yet sad read it as soon as possible it's amazing and awesome one of my favorites Read now
Be warned  This is a very sad book but it is well written and quite a story  I kept asking myself if adolescent  kids actually talk this way and think this way  These are not typical young adults
After reading it I felt needed a hard copy so splurged a little and got a set of four books by John Green If you like this book check out This Star Won't Go Out You won't regret it I promise DFTBA
This book is absolutely perfect It kills me every time I read it but gets better a well It's a beautifully written novel that should be loved and shared over and over until the writing gets buried
I've never read a greater book than this This book kept my attention the whole way through the book This is definitely now my favorite book I've ever read One word to describe this book is amazing
I just finished and already I want to read it again Was John Green trying to make his readers feel just like Hazel felt about her book I will read again and again and recommend to all my students
I'm speechless and crying I don't have anything to say other than the first sentence but I'm required to have more than four words for this to post John Green has rendered me speechless once again
From page one I had been in tears Happy sad frustrated This book left me breathless and wanting more You attach to Hazel and Gus and Isaacand even van houten Thank you for this story Truly
This was a wonderful character study of two charming challenged people probably written for young adults which I am far from but I loved the writing style and the in-depth love and learn story
I loved this book  One of the best books I've read in quite some time  A funny heartwarming and heartbreaking read From the summary you would expect it to be a sad novel and while it does have its heartbreaking moments it was a funny book to read The writing is just wonderful and refreshing I loved each and every character in this novel with the exception of one (you'll know who I'm talking about when you read this book) I could feel and understand each of their emotions to what life had thrown at them One of my favorite quotes from this book is  'some infinities are bigger than other infinities' Some events or people hold a bigger place in your heart and will stay with you forever more so than other events or people Some people are with you for a short period of your life but they affect you in ways that change you and make you someone different I just love that and I am so glad that I came across this bookLike with Hazel's favorite book I also want a sequel and want to ask the author what happens next - but I doubt we'll ever get those answersI absolutely recommend this book to everyone
I enjoyed the writing and I admit I enjoyed the characters but this type of storyline is not something I really like to spend my free time reading If you like really sad stories this is your book
I enjoyed the writing and I admit I enjoyed the characters but this type of storyline is not something I really like to spend my free time reading If you like really sad stories this is your book
This book is better then the movie But the movie was so good and the actors so awesome that I enjoyed imagining them as I read it because I watched the movie first then read the book A great read
I was reluctant to read this book as I know it deals with teens and cancer but I am glad that I did Writing is excellent and the subject matter is handled with just the right amount of compassion
LOVED IT I was crying and laughing about the way young love twists and turns beautifully but stays calm and down to earth üòçüòçüòçüòçüòçüòçüëçüëçüëçüëçüëç‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è
Well written heart-wrenching no sugar coating story about a boy and a girl who have been dealt a s***ty hand in life having to fight cancer-but they fall in love and embrace their little infinity
A really great story it kept me hooked till the end It's magical and the same time tells the harsh truth Go ahead and read it I am glad I read it before watching the movie Great work John Green
I guess I could wax lyrical about the love story and how sad it was but I won'tAll I want to say is I haven't finished reading a book in ages I finished this one in a day And I was sobbing
That was brilliant The truthfulness is so clear and accurate  I loved it All my friends and the whole country was in love and now I see why  This shows the beauty in literature Amazing quotes
It was a good story and ok to read but I didn't really care for the ending I knew it would be sad but I don't know it didn't really come to a conclusion it kinda left things hanging too much for me
John Green speaks to a new generation in a new way These are real characters with real problems Not the schmaltzy romantic notions of many YA novels This is how books for teens should be written
The book is well written but also incredibly sad  Based on the subject matter there isn't much chance of a happy ending so if you want to have a good old-fashioned cry this is the book to read
Loved the way John Green wrote this It is very conversational and an easy read I read it in like 4 days when I found time The story was sad but there are a lot of laughs too Highly recommend it
I may be the most hard hearted person alive but it was too soggy for me  Also it is written from the perspective of a dying teen and I am a senior citizen that may have something to do with it
My teenage daughter does not like to read books but with this book she could not put in down  This story reminds  me that we are all here on earth just for a while  How deep is the marks we leave
Now I'm ready to watch the movie The book is touching love story of Gus and Hazel is so deep and pure Thank you John Green for opportunity of reading this book and making us think about our lives
I absolutely loved this book I would recommend that everybody should read this book It is a heart felt story that deserves to be heard I have never liked sappy books but I still love reading this
Loved that this book was set in Indianapolis Innocent young love + teenagers with cancer = major sobfest I think I'll wait for the movie to come out on dvd rather than boohoo in a crowded theatre
Astounding Adding my five stars to a book that made me cry and laugh out loud--sometimes simultaneously The movie was outstandingthe book even better Thank  you John Green wherever you  are
Wonderful heart-warming bookvocabulary is exquisite I love Hazel Grace and GusI will never think of the  word OK in the same manner that I did before I read the The Fault in our Stars
It covers a very heavy subject in a very honest &amp; human way Of course it is an emotional read but I didn't cry all through it (only twice really) and that made it so I wanted to continue and finish
The best book I have ever read in my life and of course Green's best by a long shot I've enjoyed his other novels but I got bored in a couple of them This one was phenomenal from beginning to end
Written as through the eyes of a young adult this is a very good interpretation of how young(er) peopleview the whole situation of cancer and the prospect dieing from it I highly recommend it
This book was was amazing It was a love story that people only dream of experiencing The Fault in Our Stars is a book that is humorousbut so sad I loved this book and if you read it you will too
Incredibly moving story of love and loss  Only story I have never wanted more of because I don't want main character to lose her battle  Couldn't have predicted the ending which is very refreshing
From beginning to end this novel touched my heart I wanted to read the book before watching the movie and am glad I did Please get your teenagers to read this book - they will truly benefit from it
Words just couldn't describe the feeling for after reading the last feel chaptersAnd i wanna travel to Amsterdam so badhighly recommendedand i am exciting to watch the movie soon
It was great I saw the movie then I read the book in the 24 hours after‚Ä¶ I was happy to find the book differed some in its details and I got to relive this all-to-real love story again but better
Could not put it down  There is nothing else to say  I liked that there wasn't a lot of self pity  The characters played the hands they were dealt with humor and intelligence  It is a great read
The fault in our stars had me laughing and crying It pulls readers in with a connection to the characters feeling like Augustus and Hazel are people you know This book is a great read for any age
This was such a bittersweet well writing and just amazing book Explaining cancer and the side effects made me feel so badly for people who have to fight every day It's a very inspirational novel
Great read John Green's story is a captivating and surprising story about living and loving   His character development is masterful and I felt a connection to Hazel Gus Isaac and their families
I thoroughly enjoyed this book  I also saw the movie and it was heart wrenching and funny and gave me the same feelings as the book  I highly recommend this book to anyone who enjoys a good read
Yes it was in many ways just another book about kids with cancer But  it wasn't the same You must read it to know I feel like a secret has been shared and I alone am blessed to understand it
The subject matter could have easily gone sappy but this book takes the high road  The characters are sassy but human and the plot turns well executed  I am glad I read it before seeing the movie
I have not read anything that I absolutley loved a character in that much The book and movie were not to much different I loved where Hazel freaked on the author and when they slept naked together
This was a very good romance story  It kept me guessing the whole book  I think we all have had someone battling cancer and can relate to the struggles but not a gloomy outlook but a beautiful one
I know I'm gonna sound like everyone else who read this book when I write this review but who cares I really loved this book so it doesn't matter much about what anyone else said or says about it
Great story Hard to imagine what some people face throughout their lives Makes you grateful for your own health and helps you be more empathetic to those who are faced with hard health challenges
definite read for looking at this condition from a different perspective The author keeps it from being just a sad story He makes it to where there is realistic without the poor pitiful me attitude
The way John Green writes it's the way I think Hazel and Augustus is the love story we all want short but infinite No time for it to turn sour like most romances I would love to meet him one day
I love this book The story has a great plot something you don't expect I started reading the book and I just couldn't stop reading it really engages you I recommend this book to anybody really
Loved the flow A quick read that's easy on the mind of one who abhors over done improbable romances Although I do find teenagers who write soliloquy a bit much Overall couldn't put it down
The author showed how unfortunately people can become their diagnosis and how devastating that bitch Pity can be and how she leaves scars on the people fighting the definition of their diagnosis
This book was just absolutely beautiful I am speechless to be honest John Green wrote a book that was just so completely touching to whom ever reads this it is a book that everyone needs to read
John green spoke with such sensitivity  The stages that sick people go through are very well spoken Emotional and realistic A must read for young people to learn some empathy towards ill children
This is a great book - I was worried that I would cry all the way through it based on the story line  But I didn't  it handles new young love and death in a beautiful way  Don't miss this book
This book made me cry more than any other and that's why it's so amazing If a book can really bring out your emotions for a fictional character then the author knows what he's doing I loved it ‚ù§Ô∏è
All I can say is this made me think deeply made me cry continuously and made me question everything I have and have not done yet in this sour sad world I reside in  Amazing writer amazing story
Very realistic and it isn't the typical girly lovey dovey book that I thought it was But it was better than I thought it would've been I started it at 7 pm one day and ended at 12am the next day
Nice love story of teenagers facing death due to cancerAs love stories go made me cry  I laughed tooI don't think it's too appropriate for younger teens just my conservative opinion
I am so glad my friends convinced me to read this book It is like no other book I have ever read and I read a lot This book is for all ages and it will bring tears to your eyes when you finish it
This was a beautiful love story It is a very easy read I could not put it down once I began reading Be certain you have a box of tissues handy as I am sure your tears will be falling as were mine
Beautiful story about not only the beauty of young love but the hardships of life with sickness A very Shakespearean type of writing with a modern twist Very Romeo and Juliet-ish Beautiful tale
This book is the most amazing book I have ever read This book is something that relates to our everyday lives This book is something that captivates human nature and makes us ponder upon our lives
I read this because my niece said that she loved it and I like having stuff to talk about with her  I found it very well written I loved the characters and I cried so many times both happy and sad
Loved the quirkiness and brutal reality - made me think of illness and death in a new way  A good book pulls you in and makes you feel the emotions of the characters This book did just that for me
It was recommended by a librarian and book club friend  I loved it's different delivery and perspective  The character's were so well developed and made a difficult subject to think about bearable
When my friend told me to read this book i was a bit iffy in the beginning  but after the few first chapters i was hooked this book made me cry and laugh i defenitly recommend this to any reader
This book definitely deserved 5 star it's was perfect  It's brought tears to my eyes  It's absolutely amazing  I would an am going to read this book more than once  I'd recommend it to everyone 
I chose five stars because john green captured the true essence of never ending love and strength There is nothing I disliked This book showed the true meaning of an oblivion we cant avoid forever
My ninth grade students love John Green and now I know why This was beautiful and haunting The characters are so likable and Green deals with a tough subject realistically and with a bit of humor
This book was well written and the characters were well developed but the content is so heavy Two days later &amp; I'm still sad &amp; depressed Going back to my lighthearted contemporary romances now
A FANTASTIC book One second I was crying my eyes out and the next I was laughing so hard It is one of my all time favorite books John Green is amazing and I can't wait to read more of his books
Sometimes one just needs a little youth literature to get through the week  This book was an easy read entertaining and intensely emotional  I very much enjoyed it and look forward to the movie
This book helps teens understand and relate to the concepts of cancer and death which are everywhere The character of Augustus is a little contrived at times but overall this is a worthwhile read
I liked this book a lot because it gave me a realistic view of what cancer patients really feel like I loved the romance between Augustus and Hazel I would recommend this book to all teenage girls
This book touched my heart in every way It was perfectly written with very witty humor and and heart warming message God bless you John Green
The book arrived in great condition and it was one of the best romance novels I've ever read I honestly didn't like John Green's other novels especially Paper Towns but this really surprised me
Enjoyed the characters and enjoyed the story but was not as captivated as expected Perhaps my expectations we're too high but regardless it's a good read but not a great one in my humble opinion
This book Just so incredible is everything you heard it would be but didn't believe it was The writing is fantastical and you just love Hazel so much There are too few words and not enough time
Captivating till the bitter end  I don't cry over many books at my age  This one told truth clearly  It didn't sugar coat the dying of youth  No happy endings yet a relevant and peaceful ending
I watched the movie first then read the book  I found that the movie actually did a good job of following the book which isn't always true of movies  The story is heart breaking but very touching
It lives up to the hype I started reading this book to kill some time last night and I became hooked Now I'm getting ready to head to work without a wink of sleep but it was completely worth it
A truly lovely storyHazel and Augustus are just charming and its a very realistic view of love against all oddsIt's well written and short so it's not at all dragged out or over dramatic
Beautifully written with conversations between the characters memorable  I was able to feel the love and pain experienced by Hazel Grace and Gus  Now that's saying something ie great writing
Three pages in and I was in love the characters were so relatable that it was nearly impossible to put the book down I should have seen the ending coming but none the less it was a very good read
I was not sure to purchase this book on my way to a beach vacation place not to ruin my mood but turned out to be an enjoyable reading eventhough the story is sad Love the language and characters
I just read this book for the second time If people tell you this is a great book believe them This was as happy and sad book as well as true unfortunately I would recommend this book for sure
A most pleasnt read  We are all going to die and you feel as if you are more prepared or are more aware after reading Gus' words  MAybe we should all communicate with each other while we are here
This book was a realistic love story that could teach any child/adult at any age many life lessons -which are presented in this book Light humorous with a bitter twist Five star rating at least
I read this book to chat with one of my nieces and fell for the book Read it in two days the concept very sad but the teenagers thought patterns very interesting I recommend this book to everyone
I'll admit to seeing the movie first-but I loved it and felt like the characters were even richer having been exposed to both-and that the movie did a pretty great job of representing Green's voice
I am a high school teacher who loves to read This story is for all ages Teens will relate to the relationship between Gus and Hazel and Hazel and her parents I woul recommend this book to anyone
I loved how easy it was to connect with these characters  The author found ways to surprise me when I though get for sure I knew what was going to happen  Beautiful and amazing a true tearjerker
I didn't hate it but I didn't love or even really like it all that much  It is seriously over-rated  It reads like Dawson's Creek gets cancer  Teenagers do not sound like this It's unrealistic
A very sad yet realistic book The characters' personalities are so well developed you end up loving/hating them and wishing you could get into the book to meet them  Definitely a non-stop reading
The plot was really good but it was an easy read Things jumped from one to another so quickly His funeral the next page he's dead I liked John Green's idea but  could have been executed better
It wasn't necessarily sad not necessarily uplifting  Just a great book with great characters  I loved it so much more then I expected I would  We read it in my book club and everyone enjoyed it
A sad story that is awesome  The 2 characters share a one of a kind love - the kind of love  that only comes along once in a lifetime  They love a lifetime 's worth in a very short period of time
This is the first book that I have read in years and I absolutely loved it Though I did find myself asking questions about what happened with Hazel I will definitely recommend this book to others
Although I did see the  movie before finishing the book I am one to believe that books are much better than the movies This book was such an amazing roller-coaster that I just never wanted to end
I gave it 5 stars because I thought it was a well written book It got my attention right away It had a twist to it which was interesting I would recommend this book to teens on up male or female
I've seen the movie  The book is better  (of course)  Never stopped to think of effects of cancer on teen-agers but I've got to think this is very realistic  I'd recommend it to everyone  LORI
I was surprised at how well written this story was for a YA book I recommend this for adults as well as teens I'm looking forward to the movie now and I will look at John Green's other books too
Excellent treatment of young love Sentimental but not sappy  Witty sometimes a little unrealistic but a sweet story of three teens who live with the ever present knowledge of their own mortality
The two main characters in this story interact in a very sweet way I love a book with a twist I could hardly put it down because each page led to another adventure for them Very cleverly written
Realistic views on being a cancer patient especially having experienced and wondered the same things Must read not only as a cancer or cancer survivor but anyone interested in a true love story
It was cute but definitely for young adults I couldn't get as invested in the story as I would have liked because it was just a little too teenagery for me but hey that's who it was written for
This book is amazing it gives you a glimpse of what it's like on this earth you don't know what to expect this is a very heartwarming and emotional story of the young teenage cancer patients in love
This was an amazing book I absolutely loved every bit of it and I agree completely The universe wants to be noticed You don't have to agree to read it but I definitely do Well-done John Green
Beautiful yet heartbreaking love story -- this is a book everyone should read The writer created characters of strength love and empathy which stay in your heart long after the last page is read
This book was incredible Never have I read something so fast The times I was not reading I was thinking about it read it You will not only fall in love with the book but the characters as well
I really loved how fast it read The story was amazing &amp; sad all at the same time I wanted to read it before the movie comes out I'm glad to have met &amp; known these characters even it was so brief
This book was possibly the most beautiful bittersweet novels I've read The characters are relatable and lovable You feel their pain and revel in their joy I'd read it again Highly recommended
Worth the read I enjoyed the directness of his writing Cancer sucks Period And John didn't candy coat it We all can be dogs pissing on fire hydrants I will plagiarize and use this quote often
I recommend this book to people living with cancer and romantic people with a huge heart Anyone can read it though And OMG I WANT TO SPOIL THE BOOK BUT I CANT ITS SO AWESOME I CANT EVEN üòçüëåüòçüëå
Makes you smile laugh cry and scream  Totally eye opening when it comes to understanding how to appreciate the time you have on this Earth Amazing story couldn't believe I finished it so fast
I have never read a better book  I don't know whether people who don't have cancer would agree but I love this bookeven if it did make me bawl throughout and harder the further through it I got
I know slot of people love this book but honestly disappointed it was to me a let down towards the end i just kept thinking this can't be it I say just judge it for yourself but wasn't my favorite
This is a really well written book I will definitely read more from this author :) the story was sad but it was touching and didn't try and make cancer or to be anything than what it is ugly
If you're new to author John Green this is a good place to start If you're a JG veteran you must read this one You'll laugh you'll love it you'll hate it here's a box of tissues so get going
A wonderful mix of poetry prose philosophy and real life  The characters were so real and their feelings truly heartfelt  I guess we no more know how a story will end than we know of our lives
This book provides a deep and thought provoking look at dying through the experiences of young people and their families It tangles with concepts of afterlife and the meaning of life as we know it
This is such a well written book and I cried so much but it was one of those books where I can put it down and I read it in four hours max Love your mind going to read other books by you keep going
Loved this sweet honest story about how teens and their families deal with the devastating and painful effects of cancer Just enough humor was tossed in to off set this very heart wrenching story
Wholeheartedly recommend Intelligent funny tragic LOVE it Got to end and went right back for a second read Have recommended to friends and fam for sure And I am NOT a YA--my children are :)
Honestly I don't read but I saw a preview for the movie and thought it was good so I wanted to read the book first I am in love with this book it is so good I hope the movie doesn't disappoint me
I enjoyed this book due to the fact that it was not another cancer story but instead inspired realistic ideals With a touch of Romanism it did not drag on and was a perfect weekend read
The fact that I haven't read this book before amazes me A thoughtful yet thoughtless book full of fading hope and growing acceptance of both Gus and Hazels' diagnosis What a great book (Sighing)
I did not want to put this one down even though I was pretty sure I had an idea of how it would end All of the characters are so nicely developed it really makes the reader feel a part of the book
This is one of the best books I have ever read It isn't a sappy love story It's about two people who find each other and love each other for who they are not what they look like or what they have
I wanted to read this as the movie will be out soon I was worried it was a teen's book but I realized that the story is about true love which is ageless Written beautifully Here here Mr Green
It wasn't sad in the least bit It wasn't meant to be What it was was inspiring I'm a novelist from Kitty Hawk Carolina and these countless adjectives give me so many ideas Thank you John Green
This book was truly amazing I now have a different outlook on life-let alone cancer I'm not one who enjoys reading quite often but I could not put this slice story down Loved every bit of it :)
I gave it 5 but it's more of a 45 kind of book  I think it could have had a little more to it but because of the sensitive subject at hand I think it was done quite well  Its a very cute book
After reading the fault in our stars &amp; looking for Alaska I have fallen in love with the work of John Green he has such a beautiful way with words &amp; a colorful vocabulary to match definitely a must read
I could not put this book down and finished it in less than one day  A beautiful heartbreaking story that will stick with me for a long time  I look forward to reading more of John Green 's books
This is probably the best book that I have ever read It is amazingly written I fell in love with the characters I felt their pain and joy It was painful to have the book end 5 stars absolutely
This book is a wonderful read I laughed and cried It has been a while sinced i enjoyed a book this much Books with subject matters such as this one tent to be overly depressing but not this one
The book was absolutely great I loved how the book was told from Hazel's POV The book described true feeling and was just absolutely great to read I totally recommend it to anyone and everyone
I knew this book would break my heart and it did not disappoint John Green is amazing  I fell in love with his characters right away and could not put it down Recommend it to anyone with a heart
the characters were loveable and made you feel their pain while enjoying their storyI don't know how to articulate a review without giving away the story so just read and enjoy for yourself
Incredibly touching book that gives great perspective on some of the things we take for granted Characters are so likable that by the end of the story there is a large emotional attachment to them
Amazing story of a teenager who is terminal with cancer She falls in love learns to live a little and shares a few laughs in an uncoventional wayHeartbreaking funny witty and breathtaking
An emotional ride for sure Written from a spot on teenager's viewpoint this book is humorous at times thought provoking and deeply moving I'm well past my teen years and still enjoyed this book
Loved this book It goes beyond a teen age story of angst to  a universalstory of loss compassion and authenticity Beautifully written It is a true story of love and acceptance  and letting go
I read this book cause I seen the movie recently I'm a tearjerker and I love to cry in sad movies and I fell in love with these two characters and if I could meet john green it would be a blessing
I like how it describe the cancer and treatment and how would people feel But the book didn't catch my attention until 70% into the story It was slow pace to me But I enjoyed the last 20% of it
It was a short read filled with love wit and passion only your teenage self remembers It was a sad story of course but I was surprised to feel enlightened with the honesty this book showed me
This was a remarkable book Through these two teenagers facing death he showed us both enlightenment and melodrama And of course the galactic depth of love at any age Bravo Mr Green bravo
I didn't think this book needed any more 5 star reviews but it deserves it so here it is I'm no teenager by any means but it was still a lovely funny and touching read for any one of any age
This was one of those rare occasions where I saw the movie first but still thoroughly enjoyed this read It was intelligently written and told a realistic teenage love story-Quick read too
this has been described so many waysAmazing or sickingly sweet love story and so much more And I agree It's very very interesting and I could not put it down Love it
Great story great writing Characters are unique and keep you interested throughout Although sad there is also humor giving the reader a break from the sadness and heartache of losing loved ones
This is a very wonderful heartfelt story  Some of it made me laugh and cry  I really liked the romantic chemistry between Hazel and Augustus  Again it's an excellent novel  I'd recommend it
Gave as a gift to my  13 year old granddaughter She said it was different from the movie and each had their strong points - she said it was worth reading even after having seen the movie
I knew what I was getting into when I decided to read this book Yes it was sad but it was also joyful and bursting with love and all that is good about humanity  I painfully adored reading it
A heartbreaking tale of young love in the most tragic of circumstances It is well written but the authenticity of the time in Amsterdam leaves a little to be desired All in all a worthwhile read
It was very sad but it really makes you think about the harsh realities of life and love and tragedy Very original beautifully written All my friends told me to read this and I don't regret it
A beautiful touching young love story that feels really natural actual humorous and will make you experiment all kinds of emotions Joy Anxiety Anger Fear Great novel from an awesome author
I am not the best person at writing reviews but I loved this book - hazel grace is most inspiring and gus is a dream I'm so glad they found each other and that mr green told us their gorgeous story
I'm not writing a huge review The book was ok Dialogue was awkward at specific points and the storyline was a bit predictable It was a quick easy read but I didn't LOVE the book Just ok for me
Wow the book has been writen nicelyI have not yet finished reading itbut so far it's still nice &amp; enjoyableWhen i'm through reading the book i'll write another review to congratulate tha author
Quite realistic funny but truthful shows the meaning of the good in the bad I loved that it didn't end after ones death but when it should-far enough to know but short enough to imagine REAL
This book has such a great story and a wonderful viewpoint Hazel is a strong character that you will fall in love with from the start Definitely would recommend to anyone looking for a good read
A very true novel that aspired me to live more and abundantly enjoy more that life has to offer I now strive to be a better person and am able to come to terms with a family members passing
Beautifully written thought provoking worth every tear you will shed reading it A reminder of how precious life is and how our relationships deeply effect one another So glad to have read this
This is a wonderful and poignant book about asubject not comfortable for many people  Loved seeing two young people find love at a time that most think is unlikelyBravo to the author
Excellent book well-written At times laugh-out-loud funny and at times it'll make you cry It's heartfelt and brilliant I loved it and will read it again That's how excellent and unique it is
A good love story of star crossed individuals who found each other in rather extenuating circumstances  The book was well written kept my interest and I wanted to read it before seeing the movie
I loved this book I related to it as I have beat three different cancers and it gave me some insight and thoughts I had never thought of before I highly recommend it to those survivors of cancer
This book was recommended to me by one of my seventh grade students Although technically billed as a YA novel I found the book to be thoughtful and well written Make sure you have tissues handy
Didn't like the bookusually when I read I'm dragged into the book and all the characters would be like my own familyBut this bookdidn't wrap me init was always so far
This book is one of those books that literally grabs onto your heart and holds it to the end It grips your mind and refuses to let go until it's showed you all it contains Well worth the read
While this is a love story it is so much more It brings to light the feelings that I imagine people with terminal illnesses may have while incorporating humor This novel is beautifully crafted
I read the book because my teenage daughter raved about it and now the movie is out  No regrets here  Green does a good job here at creating characters that one can really connect to  Good read
A wonderfully heartbreaking story that is well written and will make you appreciate the people you love and be thankful for everyday you have with them I cried and laughed through the whole thing
I always have my nose in a book not many of them I consider great This book was everything and more; I laughed I cried and I continued  to think about it long after I finished it A must read
I can't get over how emotionally affected I am right now after finishing this book  I am still crying  Writing is excellentintelligent and real  Gus is just in my heart - sigh  A must read
It's amazing to see these almost real kinds of love stories This is something completely different and I love it I definitely cried and had to reach for a tissue once or twice It's a must read
The most heartthrobing story and the only one to make me shed years RIP Augustus Waters and Hazel Grace Lancaster remember everyone has a lit cigar in there mouth at all times that's why we all die
This book is so good I want to marry it I don't think there is one thing in the world I love as much as this book I fell in love with the way john green writes books Slowly and then all at once
Got this when it was on sale for kindle and was not disappointed Green crafts a pretty compelling romance between the characters and then turns things upside down right when we start to love them
The witty banter between the main characters made the book one that I had trouble putting down  Have already recommended the book to several friends and family  Can't wait to check out the movie
Some stories are written well enough to speak to your heart &amp; give you a peek into what it is like to be living with a terminal illness  This book does just that  A beautiful well written story
I enjoyed reading this but I could've lived forever without having read this book The storyline was a little jumpy and it lacked an allure for me to become emotionally invested in the characters
Loved the way the author handled the emotions and fears of two very astute young people Dying may have been a theme; but I learned a lot about living from this book and enjoyed every minute of it
The is possibly the most beautiful poignant well-written book I have ever read  I couldn't put it down It may have been written for young adults but this middle-aged woman absolutely loved it
This book has changed my life I have read many books but nothing like this At first i didn't want to read it but i am so glad that i did I was literally bawling Moody of the book Amazing job
This book was just amazing It was written really well and very emotion filled I would recommend this book to anyone who wants a good read and an insight into what life with cancer is really like
Thanks so much John Green for writing this book It has taught me many things It also made me cry A lot I have never read a story so touchy and inspirational Thanks again for this amazing book
I looked this book It was recommended to me by a friend I absolutely am so angry at John Green for***** SPOILER ALERT***********Killing Augustus SORRY IF I RUINED IT
I recommend this to anyone and everyone It was so painfully sweet and enjoyable I wish it would never end I love this book so much and it really lived up to it's great reviews Please read it
I absolutely  loved this book It isn't your typical love story girl meets boy they fall in love and have a happy ever after I could actually feel the emotion that the story was trying to convey
The Fault in Our Stars Is a wonderful story It's real  and gives perspective into the life of cancer patients True love is hard to find but this books let's all of us know true love is worth it
I found myself dreaming about the characters now Wondering if I will ever get to know what becomes of Isaac and Hazel their families and what not I guess I will have to travel and ask Mr Green
I was delightfully surprised by this book  I found it entertaining and it kept me wanting more and the characters likable and interesting  This story was a great reminder of the blessings I have
This was a very sad book (to warn you before you read it) and I cried a lot But this was a very very wonderful book and I will probably read it a thousand more times Thank you so much John Green
Let me just say that this is one of the best books I have ever read I was in tears by the hallway mark Green is a talented author who can really grasp his audience by the shoulders Amazing book
I felt the author did a wonderful job at giving a new perspective on pediatric cancer and the journey associated with it Much like Hazel and he favorite story I was not ready for this one to end
Great book heartwarming story Very easy read I had been wanting to read the book for a while and it is definitely worth reading I felt like it gave probably an honest view of how the kids felt
John Green is talented I've read 3 of his books and love them all He tells entertaining stories while making you think about serious realities His books are quick reads but are good for any age
I really enjoyed reading this book it really made you feel how young love was for your last days I definitely shed a couple of tears and I recommend it to other readers looking for a teen romance
Funny and sad Very angsty but a book about teens in love who happen to have terminal cancer deserves to be angsty I laughed out loud at times and found myself thinking about death minutes later
Loved this book The characters were easy to love There was a part in the middle where I found I lost interest a little bit but couldn't put the book down the last portion of it Highly recommend
Loved it Have some tissues handy I cried a few times Now I want to see the movie  I would recommend this book  It gave good insight in the life of a child fighting cancer or terminal illness
Fantastic I saw the movie and wasn't disappointed now that I've read the book (which is 10000x better) I'm even more not diaspoointed I would recommend this book to everyone Such a great read
I am not a type of love story person Overall the story is interesting couldn't disclose more about the story since I don't want to be a spoilerIf you like love story here's you go
I realize this is more of a YA novel so I shouldn't judge it too harshly but I have read YA novels before that I love as an adult and this one doesn't match up to its hype at least not for me
I love the writing stylefrom a 16 yr olds perspective but a brilliant one the characters are very believable and likeable This is a quick read very sad but full of heart and beautiful quotes
The book was incredible what happened between 2 teens and their family it's a emotional but fanatic book and I love this story getting the phone case for my iPhone and got the movie gonna watch it
Teenage romance is volatile enough in itself but when the teens are cancer patients this novel demonstrates how love inspires them to carry on--to try to make the best of each day they are given
this is an awesome book i had a hard time putting it down i would recommend this book to anyone that like a book that keeps you interestedthanks John GreensincerelyT Kaluzny
I loved this book because of the plot and the story It is a pretty moving book I'm not that much of a love story person tho so some parts I didn't love but all in all it was a pretty good book
Glued to the book and read it in one day and I can only say this book is poetic heartbreakingly real funny loving thought-provoking -all at the same timeI loved it and you will too
I chose 5 stars because this book was amazing and the story was so very real and funny  The main characters had an amazing connection and built a wonderful relationship in spite of their illness
An interesting and beautiful tribute to all those who live and die with cancer The protagonist's confusion about her own struggle with life and death lets us fully embrace and love her character
It was a very quick read and lead to interesting discussion  Universally liked by all in the discussion which doesn't usually happen The characters and story were fairly predictable but moving
This is really in like new condition and was a very good deal I haven't started reading it yet but I've heard great things I appreciate saving on books since I read a LOT Thank you
I love this story so much I just couldn't put it down I hope everyone someday can read this story and see the beauty in it as much as I did John Green keep making books like this one PLEASE
Yikes with all the hype of this book I really thought I'd love it but it's definitely meant for a younger crowd (I'm 29) This story was dull and predictable Wish I wouldn't have wasted my time
This book was truly enjoyable It was very enlightening and although it was very sad it did portray hope and empathy and love between two young people I would give The Fault in Our Stars 5 stars
I have never felt such deep emotion in a book and knowing someone who has died with cancer and knowing they may feel this same way that Van Houten or Hazel felt GREAT BOOK Recommended to anyone
Very well written  It was easy to fall in love with the main characters  I knew what the story was about because of the previews for the movie but was plesantly surprised by depth of the story
Although the characters' situation made this a tough read for me it is a beautiful book about relationships and living each day fully  A tough read for some including me but a very good book
I LOVED this book Not my typical genre but I will now be reading all of John Green's books Hilarious poignant heart-breaking romantic I could go on READ IT You will not be disappointed
Many would consider this a cancer story I consider it a story of life and love Hazel Grace has the outlook on life at 16 many of us wish we get before reaching 80 Touching and sad A must read
the relationship between Hazel and Gus evolves as their illnesses evolve Their beliefs about life and death change over time Their questions stay with the reader long after the book is finished
This book is more a life story than a love story  But what good story of life doesn't include both love and heartache Tis better to have loved and lost than never to have loved at all
An engrossing read which tugs the heartstrings Writtne from a youthful perspective the story provides insights to the big C An enjoyable read and a story well handled by the author Recommended
I read this book when the movie was being released Not sure I want to see the movie because parts have to be skipped I was enjoyable to read and more so since I work with a Hospice organization
I was determined to read this book before I saw it in the movies (I haven't seen it yet) But it was a beautiful story that makes your heart tearful It was awesome PS Must have Kleenex ready
I didn't think I was going to like this book at first but it didn't take long before I couldn't put it down finished in about 3 days I am really sad it's over and I'm considering reading it again
I enjoyed the story it was just okay  For me Hazel was not really likeable  Gus and Isaac were my favorite characters  Normally I can't put a book down  This was not the case for this book
You quickly figure out what's going to happen to all the characters &amp; it's your typical young-love story I thought the parts with the author character odd &amp; the van part didn't seem to flow well
I chose this rating because it was an excellent book about young love This book also opens our eyes to what patients with cancer go through and how they see the world around them Two thumbs up
Loved this book I really appreciated the character development They were so real and had such great personalities and quirks to them Definitely gave me a better understanding of cancer as well
As a grief therapist I found this novel to be beautifully written and accurate in the range of emotions in the dying and bereavement process I will be using this in therapy with several clients
I picked this up after reading The Fault in the Stars I wasn't sure what to expect I did truly enjoy the book I think Green captures what I expect a quirky teenager firing of cancer to be like
I really wanted to like it but I found it tedious and juvenile I ended up scanning chunks of pages at a time bored with the characters Was glad when it was over Oh and I predicted the twist
Once I started reading I literally couldn't put it down  These young people offer us all a new perspective on our lives - how to value and savor each day as a gift  Very uplifting and enjoyable
The book was a quick read and pretty good although I found parts of it quite boring and there are a lot of words in there I did not understand  I can see where it will make a great movie though
The Fault in Our Stars truly captures life the beautiful mess of it all Tragic funny warm and real this read will have you laughing and crying over it's honest nature and instant love story
This was a unique love story about 2 young people who both had terminal cancerI recommend it to teenagers but can be enjoyed by adults as well I look forward to seeing the movie this week
The story was sad but colorful  The main characters although terminal cancer patients reminded us how precious and wonderful life is when each day moment and person in our lives is celebrated
This book shows the truth behind a horrible disease but at the same time takes what looks like a hopeless situation and makes it the best most heart warming and heart wrenching love stories ever
This book was amazing Even though the messages were serious it still had moments that hit every emotion It was also funny yet heart-wrenching It was worth every penny and I will read it again
Very easy read Makes you think about things more than normal Great writing My 12 year old daughter wants to see the movie when it comes out and I know that movies are never as good as the book
The Fault in Our Stars is a beautifully written book that gives us some insight as to how a terminally ill patient feels/thinks I was very emotional throughout the book It was a very quick read
Didn't plan on reading this until my girlfriend made me After I agreed I was swept away by it couldn't put it down it gave me a new look on life and how the universe just wants to be noticed
While the story was ok the author did a poor job of telling it As a reader I felt very much outside of the story I would have appreciated it if the book were a bit longer but more descriptive
This book is definitely a page turner I read this book in 3 days with free time at work When I wasn't reading it I was thinking about it That's how good it is And I can't wait to see the movie
The Fault in Our Stars is about two cancer kids but the book isn't about cancer It is filled with love heart break drama action humor and much more All I have to say is; READ THIS BOOK
While reading this I kept wishing I were still an angst-ridden teen so this could be my manifesto This was a book worth reading and I think that there is a lesson or two in this work for us all
Absolutely loved this bookits poignant sad and loving  Green tells the story with humor and grace  I would recommend it to anyone even if this doesn't fit into their usual genre of reading
I read this book to prepare for the movie release; now I won't even be seeing the movie beacuse I was so satisfied with the story the characters and even the ending I highly recommend the book
I loved this book everything about it was like reality it was just amazing from beginning to end I've recommended this book to literally everyone I know I have read it again about 5 more times
Never read such a book that made me cry and laugh all at the same time This book has left a mark inside of me that I will carry on forever I recommended this book to everyone I love John Green
A painful beautifully written touching story of the human spirit and our own humanity Really makes you consider the joys in life that we take for granted and often allow to slip away unnoticed
I cried reading this book i love drawn out detailed love storys This took me forever to read just cause i dont have time to read but it was definitely worth my time i cant wait for the movie :)
It's more than a simple love story It's a testament to the power of relationship Absolutely loved it Beautifully written More than just tugging on your heart strings it will write a new song
I have to say that I loved this book It keeps you interested at all time and makes you think about so many blessings in your life that you dint even know you had I totally recommend this book
this novel is very intriguing and fast to read the story is absolutely touching with nspired characters I enjoyed theteen positive focusromantic components and toughhonestly
This book was AMAZINGLY told and seemed very realistic  While I loved this book i was also very depressed by the way the story was told Then again the depressing tone helped to tell the story
This was the best book I have ever read  It's just perfect And Augustus waters - I just can't even Asdfghjkl Ugh I mean this was just such a wonderful book I'm 12 and I read it in 1/2 a day
I cried way more than I should have  this is one of the best books in the history of words on paper Or in my case screens thisbookisamazing#tfios#can't wait for the movie
I am rendered speechless this book is for lack of words BEAUTIFUL A must read This may not mean much but I promise you (to whom it may concern) will LOVE it At least half as much as I do
I've never read the same book twice but just in case I missed something I'll be reading this again I'm still crying I read this book in a day I could not put it down I did not want it to end
Beautifully written  Brings you back to teenage love againWorth the tears  John Green even brings out the comedic side in the protagonist which helps with the tears that roll at the end
I very much enjoyed this book and it's attitude towards cancer and perception of love The story of Hazel and Augustus' battle against cancer and their love for each other was amazing Great read
I couldn't stop crying during the end I'm still crying now while writing this This is now my favorite book and most likely always will be It is worth all the money it costs I love this book
Interesting look at life and death from young people with a lot to look forward to and no expectation of being able to do that  Although it is fiction it still presented an interesting viewpoint
Have a more perfect book ever been written I loved this book Too much While I sit here crying I feel happy because they had each other but sad at the same time This book was utterly brilliant
The book was simply written and the character development was questionable  Although the reality of the situations were noteworthy  Half of our book group loved it and the others felt as I did
I'd read John Green's Paper Towns before reading this book so I was anxious to see if it was as good as Paper Towns and boy was it I had read the last page before reading the book Why Because I like to make guesses about what happens in the book based off of what the last page says and let's just say that my guess was completely off in a sad and bittersweet way I thoroughly enjoyed reading from Hazel's point of view because we think alike in some respects and it's really nice to find someone who thinks like I do even if they're not actually real or not The strange thing about this book is I lent it to my mother once I was done with it and while she was reading it (she's a nurse) had a patient admitted that had the same issues as Augustus right down to the very small details surrounding him He was the same age as Gus was too and ultimately had the same fate that Gus does This book is a tear-jerker at some moments and makes you think about what your legacy will be when you leave Earth whether you usually have those thoughts or not If you haven't read this book before I highly recommend it
First of all this book is beautifully written  The characters are charming unique unquestionably sweet and likable  The plot is unique and the situation draws you in like a train wreck that you don't want to see but can't look away fromFrom the get-go you know that there is no possibility for a happy ending as Hazel is terminal  And from the get-go you know you just know that something tragic is going to unfold that is going to leave you sobbing into your hanky  And yet I read it any wayAnd I wish that I hadn't  I get no enjoyment out of books that leave me mourning for characters that didn't make it to the very end  I loathe books that make me cry make me think of friends and family who have passed and make me yearn for a world in which there was no cancer  I hate being that invested in fiction to the point where I am sad for the loss of imaginary people and my heart aches for imaginary parentsIf you love a tear jerker and pathos and exquisite agony then you will love this book  If you're more of a fan of happy endings read something else
O M G Best Book Ever Sixteen year old Hazel has terminal cancer But that is not what this book is about It is about life love friendship hope joy and sorrow You just have to read it
This was a great heart warming story Having experienced health issues as a child I felt a great connection to the characters From cover to cover the book was flawless and impossible to put Dow
This is one of the best books I have ever read 999% of people will cry because of this book The characters are funny and so poetic it's scary I absolutely love this great piece of literature
Don't read this without a box of tissues but it is also full of joy It made me remember my philosophical teen years multiplied to infinity by terminal cancer Great dialogue exceptional story
This was a great book It was a good read that made you not want to put it down At a few points in brings tears to your eyes but it also makes you laugh out loud I highly recommend reading it
This book is a wonderful I must not take my eyes off this book This is a definite teen romance and drama that MUST be read before the movie And I will say that this is masterpiece in fiction
Amazing this flirty and twisted love story will forever change you and will forever stay in your hearts John Green has once again written a book thsat has and forever will touch people's hearts
This book is written in such a way that these characters are people you wish you were friends with It's intimate and clear with a different look at love that makes me want to be a better person
Vary few books make me thinkreally think like this one does Green is a phenomenal author and I can't wait to read moreand in turn learn more about what's always been right in front of me
Excellent quick read John Green knows how to tell a story I read the entire book on a flight because I couldn't put it down - it was funny and emotional I may have shed a few tears in flight
I have a lot to say about this book It is amazing It is raw It is not for the faint at heart I could read it over and over again just because of the wonderful story A must read for everyone
This book was sad but so incredible and I love that its not about dying or sickness its about love and i HIGHLY recommend this book The book was funny sad and so many emotions I just loved it
This book was a great length and I couldn't put it down I completely lost it the last quarter of the book It makes you think about the tangibility of life I most definitely recommend his book
Wonderful Wonderful Wonderful This book is amazingly touching and yes will have a little bit in tears I def recommend this book to anyone who has loved lost n/or has fought for their life
Very good read  Good themes  As a teacher wondering if I could have middle schoolers read this  I think it will need to go to school board level for a vote but I did think it was a great book
Somehow the author managed to weave reality in with humor (and some nonsense) and create a love story that is poignant difficult to put down and heart-wrenching but uplifting at the same time
Though this book was quick and easy to read I was completely engulfed to the very last word It was very interesting to think of this life changing disease from the affected persons perspective
Very well written with excelllent character developmentI became so connected to them and their feelings ideas and situationsGreat story and would recommend it as a definite read for everyone
Decided to read this book with my 13yr old daughter before we went to see the movie  What a beautiful and touching story of hope and about young love that was impressingly mature  Great book
A wonderfully written story of living life knowing you will only be on this world a short time  So witty and touching and as many laugh out loud moments as tears made this an all time favorite
This book gives you a such different perspective on life and really makes you think of what life means to you How am I living life How am I being remembered Amazing book Simply amazing Okay
I loved this book so completely that I wish their was more and that it was a never ending story Except for the fact that Augustus dies I literally cried at that part and I never cry about books
Although I am not a young adult - I found the story well told and believable  Hazel and Augustus meet in a cancer support group so you know  right away they are dealing with big stuff for teens
I downloaded the book and started reading I  could not put the book down finished reading in one day The story line was funny happy sad and frustrating Wonderful book about life and death
My reason for reading this book was to have a connection with my tween granddaughter who loved the book  I truly enjoyed the book and the bonus was discussing it with my granddaughter
This is a great story about living with cancer instead of dying from it  From the perspective of two people who fully understand the fragility of life  Couldn't stop reading it once I started
I Loved it but be ready for tears It isn't the happy ending most hope for but still makes you feel good about Love Also helps us going day by day monotonously see life in others eyes Must read
This book was amazing I loved every minute of it Finally a young adult novel other than the hunger games that I enjoyed I'm a 25 year old guy and I think any guy or girl would enjoy this story
Wow I have never read a book quite like this it easily the best thing I have ever read in my entire life John green's writing is amazing and frankly I would be happy to read his grocery list :)
The Fault in Our Stars was beautifully written with each moment fitting perfectly together at the right time John Green brings up interesting points and each character is thoughtful and unique
The Fault in our Stars was an incredibly moving story Sad yet inspiring Would love to know what comes of the remaining characters I have recommended this book to all of my family and friends
This book was everything that people made it out to be It had characters you connect to and invest in Even with having heard about the ending it still hit me hard I highly recommend this book
Beautiful story Green captures the plight of the ill set to a true love story The story can get (what feels) unnecessarily wordy at times(dry) but this does not detract from the book's beauty
it was an easy read (finished in a few hours) good beach read i think endearing funny - i found the characters to be super lovable as they shared my sarcastic sense of humor sad but lovely
This novel will pull and push at every emotion you have in your being It will feel horrible and rotten at times but I assure you the finished project of well worth everything else Okay okay
This is the mist amazing book i finished in about 24 hours stayed up on schools nights but needed rest and it sucked in school not knowing what happens next i highly suggest this book to evreyone
This book was many things ~ touching entertaining and thought provoking  Mainly it was emotional and draining  I fell completely and utterly in love with Augustus  This book is a must read
This book was a great reflection of true love and sacrifice You can tell that the author has put so much thought in to the plot and characters This book can inspire manny and menny to comeüòä
I enjoyed this book The story was sweet Who doesn't like a good love story I feel bit like Hazel wondering what happens to Anna What happens to Hazel  I will probably read this one again :)
This was everything I want in a book:  engaging characters in unusual day-to-day situations well done with humor and style  The main characters are teenagers but as an adult I loved this book
I never imagined in all my life a book could make me cry so much not with sorrow but with tears of hope and joy This story is one of amazing quality that you will hate and love at the same time
If you're not one for tears this isn't for you But if you don't mind leaking eyes read along as you get sucked into the emotions of several different relationships played out in vivid writing
It's heart warming and very emotional It really changes the view on how I see people with cancer and how life is so precious and that every minute you should spend being happy I love this book
I loved the story of Hazel and Agustus And i really enjoyed all of the characters This story will really make you fall in love with characters It'll make you smile laugh and cry A must read
Justsoperfect I was very ill and near death many of times at that age This was beautiful Even if you've never been through anything like this yourself it teaches you something about life
I knew going into this book that it was good and that I would like it But oh my God how much I liked it If you're reading this to decide whether or not to buy it you should definitely buy it
This book pulled me in and never let goI was just looking for a quick read and never realized this great adventure of life and death that i was going to be taken on Totally worth reading
I love how this story stayed real to the reality of cancer There was pain there was joy in the story just like life Green has a gift for language and conveying the feelings of his characters
This book will break your heart but have you wishing there was another page chapter sentence Although it's classified as YA I highly recommend this book to everyone It's beautifully written
I liked this story A chance for folks/kids to think outside themselves and realize there are people with bigger problems than yours and even with and illness like cancer  you can still find joy
You can pretty much know you are going to like/ love this book after the first chapter Characters are pure The story is told with enough originality and feeling so it doesnt turn into a cliche
Cried my eyes out Beautiful story and beautifully written You can tell this was written by a man as most of the scenes and statements give off a masculine air I throughly enjoyed reading it
I give this book a 5 star rating  It's a funny and romanticThis book is a great Book for 10 and overIf you read this book I hope you'll enjoy because I did
Could I possibly say that hasn't been said already I laughed found inspirational quotes and of course I criedI gave the book the rating I did because I feel it deserves nothing less
I loved this book and gave it a five star because it has a strong favoring of emotion and tells a sad but true story about life I hope you consider to read this book for it is truly amazing
I enjoyed this book a lot This is not a negative comment but I was glad that I could read this love story without crying for hours I already have enough sadness I needed some love I got it
I had heard too much hype and thought I would be reading a classic Instead I found that I did not particularly like the heroine Gus was a good character and redeemed the story for me somewhat
I laughed and cried during the reading of this book  The playful flirtation between characters and the witty repertoire made this a very easy read  I read this book during 1 night of insomnia
I loved this book I stayed up almost 5 hours just to get through it I thought it was going to be pitiful But it turns out to be notProbably recommended for a teenager but I loved it
love the storyline easiest book to pick up but the hardest book to put down  Book is filled with tears and joy sickness and health great literature  Would recommend this book to anyone 12+
This book is amazing I've wanted to watch the movie for so long now Now that I have finally finished the book im gonna go watch it rite now I'm so excited  better go get my box of tissues :(
This amazing book brings to light the strength and dignity that people can havehealthy peoplesick peoplejust people  choices made as to how to live your life or think about just living
This was a great story of a young person with cancer and their perspective of how things are going  I got the book in perfect condition and have passed it on to others Everyone has enjoyed it
This was so touching and amazing to me as a teenager I loved the way Green use his words to explain the difficulties in both Hazel and Augustus' life It is definitely one of my favorite books
My 12 year old son and I are reading together I've stayed a few chapters ahead so I know what he's 'reading and can help him  through it We both love the bittersweet humor can't put it down
Simply amazing this would touch the heart of the young and old I've read many many books but this is officially the first novel to make me grab the tissues I would recommend this to anyone
This book is touching to hearts it isn't a fake it's real It tells people what it is like for people with cancer and explains about it Not in the boring way in a reality way It shows life
This beautiful story rings true on many levels but sometimes is a little far-fetched I guess for a young adult book it is a good way to explain deaths but for an old adult  it is too contrite
The book told a very life lesson  Some of the words were hard to understand but by reading on you get the jest of what he is saying  Not sure if I want to see the movie now or not
I didn't want it to end Reality is cruel and painful The characters in this book help ease that great pain They teach us that it is okay to be an observer and okay to love the unlockable
Great quick read The topic may have been depressing but the reader was given a close up view of how the human spirit can triumph when provided with the riches real friendship and love provide
Absolutely loved - I loved the casual feel but the language was beautifully written and makes you think about life and the what if's  Several great quotes that I had to highlight
I felt the emotions of a teenager through Green's writing Deep but not too deep to get hurt Beautifully written about young love and the realities of a hopeless future at least here on earth
THIS IS SUCH AN AMAZING BOOK I CRIED TWICE AND UGGGGHHHHHHHREAD IT YOU WILL BE AMAZED AT HOW MUCH THIS BOOK WILL CHANGE YOUR VIEW OF THINGSGET IT AND GET IT NOW
Very heartwarming and realistic story Very sad but beautifully written Obviously well researched and while it is fiction having experienced the cancer journey with a loved one I can empathise
I enjoyed reading this 'coming of age' story about a 16 girl with cancer  I know the movie is out but not sure I want to see it but would rather keep my own version (in my head) of the story
It didn't live up to all the hype I thought it would have been an amazing story given all of the recognition and recent film release But something was lacking and I can't put my finger on it
I loved the wordplay and the depth of the characters  This book was hard to read in places because I got so involved with characters but so touching  I'd recommend it to anyone young to old
I have never read a book or seen a movie where not one thing could have been different to make it any better John Green and the cast of the movie were perfect and everything was amazing &lt;3
Never thought I would love a book about terminally ill children as much as I loved this one  I connected to the characters so easily they could of been my children Heartbreaking but so honest
Not so sure  It was just plain sad young love dying from cancer It was a great portrait into the lives of teens and their families living with cancer but that's about it It was a quick read
This has got to be the best book I have ever read The way John Green wrote this book was absolutely inspiring and breathtaking I recommend this book to any and everyone you will not regret it
I read this book because of the trailer of the upcoming movie I loved it I laughed smiled and even cried (I know sap right) I recommend this book without reservations New John Green fan
A sad painful brilliant novel The characters are wonderfully developed The story sucked me in from the very first sentence and held me rapt until the very last I highly recommend to anyone
Wonderful book So sad made me cry at least 10 times The twists and turns of this book are incredible I love this book and I believe everyone person in the world should read this magical book
Although you anticipate where this story will end it is not the journey you might expect This is not about being ill but how two people love and support each other through extraordinary times
If ever there were a book to make you question your own mortality and human nature in general Cried like a baby and I don't cry often Such a wonderful book oddly filled with hope Love Wow
My Granddaughter made me read this booknot only because it's going to be showing on June 6th and we are going to see it but also because John Green is her favorite authorIndeedit was great
honestly this book is going to make me a better person you need to see people for who they are not what they are doing and I don't know what you want to think of this book but this is what I see
This I as my first book I have read by John green It's was funny and warm outstanding strong characters that had me laughing out loud and weeping  Absolutely loved it  I am reading it again
This book was awesome It was filled with sadness joy struggle disappointment and most of all heroism I loved the comical approach to living (coping) with such a serious disease Loved it
I never cared enough to write a review before and I don't give the five stars lightly I was so engrossed that I read the book without stopping I even forget to take my pain medicine on time
Loved the entire book from the first word to the last The characters stole my heart and I completely got caught up in the love they shared If only there could be a sequel to this book as well
I loved this book so much I couldn't put it down for more than a second You did amazing at describing everyones feelings and wow just wow the Fault in our Stars is one of my new favorite book
Very talented writer and poignant story  Insightful introduction to the human suffering associated with cancer that complicates in young people struggling to find their way through adolescence
This book was as good as a love story can get with the intense twists of love and sorrow Definitely needs to be read by everyone in existence because I can for sure say it was my favorite book
This book was amazing Although I still wish the outcome occurred differently As I've told before I drowned in my own tears You'll need 200 boxes of tissues 100 for the book 100 for the movie
What a wonderful voice Green has developed dynamic characters The plot makes you laugh and cry Great for teens to read but also a fun read for adults who really want to know what kids think
May this book leave a scar on your heart and may you be forever changed by the tender sweetness and chastising honesty of Hazel Grace and Augustus Thank you John Green for this story
Couldn't put the book down It was so easy to feel the emotion of the characters I cried through out the whole second half It's amazing how one book can draw out so much emotion from a reader
This book was amazing I cried and laughed wish it was longer My daughter and I will definitely be going to see this movie We are in love with the characters A must readagain and again
It's just fantastic Green captures the voice of a young woman who is forced to grow up at an accelerated rate so accurately It's witty sharp and memorable You won't regret reading this book
I cannot decide if I loved or hated this novel Maybe it's both I have not stopped crying but it was so well written and brought some type of joy while I was reading it Definitely a must read
This book makes you think I like a book that makes you think differently then you usually do I almost cried in several parts though the author makes you feel for the characters Great book üëç
I loved this book Even thought it left me crying on an airplane like a crazy person I would read it again and again The characters are lovable and real You really want the best for everyone
I would definitely recommend this book to many people who haven't read it yet I love the story so much I cried during the book I hate that it's over and I can't wait for the movie to come out
This book is amazing I can't even begin to comprehend how much I love this book It is amazing that a man can write from the perspective of a teen girl with cancer Amazing a must read Love
Excellent book My daughter (14yo) was reading it and kept remarking how good it was and that I (52yo) should read it So I took her advice It's a great book to read together Very captivating
A truly deep and meaningful look into teenagers falling in love and battling cancer at the same time An uplifting story that makes you question if you are really living each day to the fullest
I thought the character development was fantastic  I really enjoyed the writing style  I actually missed the characters when I finished the book  I also thought the ending was very well done
Hazel and Augustus are teenaged cancer survivors who meet at a kids cancer survivor group They are immediately attracted to one another These are not normal teenagerstheir disease has caused them to mature in ways that most of us can not imagine Despite their realistic world view (or perhaps because of it) they each have a wickedly fun sense of humor that may cause you to laugh out loud Along with Hazel and Augustus we also meet their parents and friends who are just as humorous and lovable It is nearly impossible not to feel affection for all of these charactersWe are permitted to watch the relationship between Hazel and Augustus grow and what an honor it is I really don't want to say much about the plot for fear of spoiling it for anyone But trust me this book will make you laugh and cry like a babyhave a box of tissues on hand when you read it You may also want to jot down some of the very quotable things these characters say for later reflection It is a phenomenal book John Green is a genius I absolutely loved this book and may read it again in the future
I got this book for a book club I'm in and it's not bad for a tragedy romance but make no mistake that's definitely what it is If that's not what you are looking for its probably not for you
This book is my favorite book of all time John Green is amazing and on a scale of 1--10 this book (for me) is infinity even if some infinities are bigger than others :) BEST BOOK EVER
Heartbreaking story but one that almost every individual can relate too Very well told and surprising twists Highly recommend to anyone touched by cancer or any other life altering illnesses
So good It was a touching love story with perspectives I never would have thought of It changed my life forever(Plus It's worth a lot of AR points)Spoiler alert: Augustus dies üò≠
I hated how it ended I wanted to know what happened to Hazel Maybe it ended like that to parallel the book she loved But now I want to email the author and ask all the questions Hazel asked
I read the book after seeing the movie and I loved it Some points I cried and some I laughed and once I got towards the end it was hard to stop reading This one book I would read over again
Get your Kleenex ready  A warm loving story; very emotional  Interesting that a 16 year old girl with terminal cancer is so concerned about what will become of her parents after she is gone
It was a good book Very sad at a certain point I knew what would happen but it still didn't make the experience any less genuine I literally called my best friend at 3am crying hysterically
A quote from this story sums it up well:You have a choice in this world I believe about how to tell sad stories and we have made the funny choice page 209Thoroughly enjoyable
I saw the movie version before I read this book I have to say I found the book much better than the movie  One word of advise you may want to grab a tissue before starting to read this one
This was the best book I have ever seen in my life with the thrill of the love and slight comedy in the book I will have to read it again and share the book with my family members and friends
I couldn't put this book down I read it in one sitting and loved every word of it The writing is so real I felt like I was right there with Hazel and Gus I just wish the story went on
Wow wanted to get this and read before I see the movie and I am not sure I want to see it now I am not sure it can live up to this book Amazing writing and characters Loved this so much
I enjoyed the book  I've never read anything of John Green's but I enjoyed his writing  We can all relate to someone we know  that has dealt with the ugliest disease known to mankind Cancer
The first book that I took and read for two days to finish reading it I will tell others to read it as well I was told by my cousin who had read it for school to read it and I am glad I did
While this is a YA novel adults will not be disappointed We all remember what it feels like to be in love for the first time Add in cancer and the emotions run wild Well written throughout
The Fault in Our Stars is a beautifully written book about relationships and the challenges people face when fighting disease and watching others face the fight as welltouching and fragile
I truly enjoyed reading this book Puts life (&amp; death) in perspective Such young strong characters I recommend this book to anyone of any age Hazel &amp; Gus are the utmost reflection of courage
I just finished reading this book and it was a great read my mother died of cancer so I can see where although fiction there is some truth spoken in those fontsand I highly recommend this book
I have no idea why or how Mr Green wrote this book but I'm so glad he did Once started life had to stop so I could finish which only took a few hours Seriously all the feels in one book
John Green made a way for the reader to love each character in a unique way  I shared their daily lives in a new way without all the unnecessary pathos but the necessary insight  Well done
I wanted to read the book before seeing the movie  It is a very thought provoking book and does make you realize how good life is  I have and will continue to recommend this book to everyone
I LOVED THIS BOOK SO SWEET AND WITTY THE CHARACTERS WERE SO ALIVE AND REAL CAUGHT MYSELF LAUGHING OUT LOUD ON SEVERAL OCCASSIONS BUT ALSO HAD THE KLEENEX OUTSO HAPPY THEY MADE A MOVIE
Narrated by Hazel a 16 year old cancer patient about her life and relationships She has a good wit and perspective on life I highly recommend just remember to have a box of tissues near by
LOVED IT A fresh voice funny clever honest Such a sad book in one way yet so uplifting at the same time At last a book that doesn't assume all teenagers are brainless and without depth
flawlessly written cliche but it certainly kept me on the edge of my seat As I read the last page I immediately wanted to open it back up and read it again few books make me feel that way
This book was so good i finished it in less than two days The movie didn't capture all that the book did as usual I put this up as one of my personal favorites Totally recommend this book
are you serious  great story but you left us hangingI guess you want us all to make our own  not just your story but what happen to Anna s mom I guess the world will never know
Over-hyped slightly disappointing but still a good read For characters who seemed determined to not be stereotypical cancer kid stories it sure seemed like that is where this book ended up
I encourage anyone regardless of your age to read this book  I believe this would be an excellent story to be read in high school English class  Excellent story and portrayal of characters
I loved the book  Being old enough to be Hazel's grandmother I thought the book might be trite  But it is excellent and very funny  It's a beautiful love story and a beautiful look at life
From beginning to end this book kept me wanting more It was funny sad and in it's own way happy It makes you think about every little thing It makes you analyze life and what's within life
this book was easy to read it has a good meaning that the world needs to understand The foreshadowing is a little thick and made some of the ending predictable but overall a worthwhile read
A poingnant wonderfully written journey through life's most diffcult hardships  A must read for anyone that's been in love had an illness or just to prep yourself for the forthcoming movie
this could have been gory and medically gruesome  it's not The extreme awfulness of the characters' situations is handled with tact and taste  The book is no joyride but well worth reading
this book was simply perfect It had humor to contrast with the heart breaking plot it had advice and ideas that most of us won't ever think of until reading this beautiful tale of young love
I did not expect what happened to happen at all It was super sad and happy and the ending was kinda fast but happy I will definitely read this again I also really want to see the movie
This was the best book ever This death felt necessary Unlike some series *Cough* Allegiant Augustus had to die to make the book end It was necessary It was the bow on the package &lt;3 TFIOS
Sucked me right in  Read it and weep  The raw honesty and comedic timing on such a dark subject is refreshing and real I'm sad it's over and I've gained perspective I needed from reading it
This book is amazing its the best book I've ever read i urge you to read it The author did a beautiful job creating such  wonderful story Please give it a chance you will not be disappointed
The author wrote this book perfectly Very unexpected ending asking myself if there be short story of HazelI must say I'll probably cry when I see the movie Well written Love this book
I read this book in an afternoon I could not put it down I cried like a baby but seriously loved the book I cannot wait for the movie to come out Hopefully they follow the book pretty well
BEST BOOK EVER I might have cried for three hours but oh my god üòçüòçüòç you must read this book John Green you are amazing and mmmm maybe you're my uncle cause were both Green's but whatever
I thought this was just going to be some heartwarming novel about an odd love story No no no It's more than that I cried like a baby I did not see most of it coming Dang you John Green
Green does a great job of creating two characters that find the value of living life even in the shadow of death A sweet friendship blossoming into a love of a lifetime that I will read again
It is truly one of the saddest and most well written books I have ever read It is great I totally recommend this book to those who are in need of a romantic heartfelt and adventurous book
This book is not only beautifully written intelligent and emotional but it is eye opening to a world of the sick and dying and those they leave behind I am still crying and yet also smiling
This is a spectacular book as most John Green books are This book will make you laugh cry and be angry all at the same time I recommend this book to anyone who is looking for a great read
Straightforward and poignant Green tells it like it is in the very real struggle of cancer This book is reminiscent of My Sister's Keeper but unique in its love story and genuine perspective
This book is very good I absolutely loved it the book reached  a lot of valuable life lessons and its definitely a book I would recommend to all The quotes in the book are also very powerful
This book made me laugh smile and cry I read it in a day because every page left me wanting more I plan on rereading it over and over again This is honestly the best book I have ever read
if you consider what the book is about you can pretty much tell what's going to transpire throughout the book regardless its a great read that'll definitely make you tear up a couple of times
A total cry fest down to the very last page But so worth it You'll laugh cry and philosophize from the interaction between these two teenagers of all things Absolutely LOVED this book
This book is just amazing It is a roller coaster of emotions It will make you laugh and cry I highly recommend this book to everyone It will take your breath away with every twist and turn
One of the best books I ever read I normally don't read books like thiswith a heavy story linebut I couldn't put the book down As soon as I started reading I couldn't stopIt's a must read
This book was breathtaking and heartbreaking It really sheds light upon the subject of young love and very ill people This book really got to me I'm actually still trying to recover from it
Thank you John Our universe noTHE universe is beautiful;the meaning of life or the journey in life is ambivalenceThank you for letting me know I am not alone in this struggle
I am ordering throught AMAZON toomany items  I am very satisfied with their products and service  That is way I am ordering a lot  So many that I dont have time to write reviews IT IS GOOD
I recommend this book to everyone young and old alike (even though it is listed as a young adult book) It offers an honest look at teens dealing with cancer and love and life and end of life
I thoroughly enjoyed this book the fact that it takes place in Indy the character development and that I'd be laughing then crying in minutes Gave a new perspective to dying of
This story will stay with me for a long time The love that Augustus and Hazel shared is truly captivating even in the face of the terribleness of cancer Excellent read and I highly recommend
Not a book to read for pleasure  The story tries to link young love with the tragedy of dying cancer patients  It is not a good combination  It does however make a person glad to be alive
The book was really great but sad And not a little sad Like don't-read-in-public-because-it-will-make-you-cry-like-your-whole-family-has-died sad Not to deter readers It's worth it Enjoy
John Green does it every time He hooks you really good reels you in and he makes reading his work so wonderful I would recommend this book to absolutely anyone It would be a great  present
I actually LOL'd in a few spots  There were parts where i felt like skipping pages because it was dragging on  Overall a good read and I'll be looking for more books by John Green
All right I admit it I got suckered into this I'm a sucker for autographed copies and it had a fine quote by Judi Picoult on the cover and Wal-Mart was selling it at a deep discount So what if I never heard of the guy Then I get home and find out is is young adult lit which I never read not even Harry Potter and worse it is about young adults dying of cancer which topic I avoid since it depresses the hell out of me (Then I find out he signed a bazillion of them and I was tripping over signed copies at every book store I went into I got the only one at that Wal-Mart and thought I had something special) Well I decided to give it my 50 page test - any book is entitled to that and got hookedThe writing is masterful and the story and characters interesting Yes it has some moments that rip your heart out and bring tears to your eyes but it has some great humor and high points The pure humanity of it just put me awaySo John thanks for a great read I don't know if our paths will cross again but it was a fine experience to have them cross this once
I love how the characters described bu the author I almost forgot that I'm reading because of the way how it is written I love how my mind works with the flow of the story and every details
Tragic funny sad beautiful A fascinating love story between two struggling souls Both dying and both more worried about who they'll hurt in death than actually worried about death itself
This book had so many different feelings in itI felt all of themIt reached deep into my heart and twisted it and poured itself into itThis book will stay with you forever
John green is amazing with words This book is so well written and I love it because it is so true He plays with your emotions- happy sad heartbreaking funny Everything I love this book
Beautiful prose wondrous and deep  I am slightly annoyed that my review must be 15 words long when fewer words are better than verbosity I find  Nonetheless This book is not to be missed
I have never read a romance I finally got the courage and decides to read one I chose The Fault In Our Stars I love this book but I don't enjoy the way that it ends It is a wonderful book
This book really sends a messagea good and tearful one I couldn't stop reading it This story is written for people who love cry and rejoice in fearit is definitely worth your time
This book made me cry and appreciate the fact that I have the privilege to love my special someone over and over again I don't know what I would do without him this is just perfectly worded
Love the book I like this particular story because it makes me appreciate more my life and my health Is lot like A Walk to Remember but a funnier version I love the book but hate the movie
Although this is a Young Adult novel I LOVED it  It's a quick read but it's also a story that sticks with you because of the love emotion and difficulties the kids in the novel experience
I chose this book because it was a popular title and I loved the story line I did find it slightly confusing but other than that you better get your tissues ready cause it is very dramatic
fault in our stars- John GreenHe wrote an amazing book as I said before it was heart warming and depressing at the same time If you are looking for a new book I highly recommend it
I liked it I knew the basic storyline before I started &amp; thought I would cry a lot  Maybe I'm all cried out from other things right now but I did not cry  It was well written &amp; beautiful
touching and impossible to put downthis novel is a must- read for teens an young adults it is vey emotional and i cried a few times while the movie is also amazng and it is worth the money
I laughed I cried I was constantly amazed by the people in this book  Hazel Grace and  Augustus while not like anyone I have ever met were two people I loved to eavesdrop on  Great book
HeartbreakingAlthough I loved this book it was heartbreakingas was the movie The story and writing is wonderful I absolutely recommend this book to anyone who loves a good love story
It's not your stereo typical cancer book It made me smile and it made me cry The story pulls you in and doesn't let you out I thoroughly enjoyed reading this book It's one of my favorites
This is a very good story about young people dealing with their own mortality  Though seriously ill the main characters were able to find joy and peace in their relationship with each other
Excellent story about some kids who are truly interesting individuals and oh yeah they happen to be fighting an illness I haven't seen the movie yet but the book was worth reading for sure
I got recommended this book from a couple of my friends and I don't doubt reading it at all its a very touching story and very emotional and descriptive I loved it so I gave it a 5 star rating
It was a lovely book  Very well written  I associated very much with this book because I lost my beautiful son to leukemia  I was very touched by the  love shared by these two young teens
i love this booki cried when i found out that he diedi love john green bookshazel was going through a tough time i was like that too she found her true love i did too
This book is amazing the conversations are funny yet deep This book makes you think about life in a different perspective It also renewed my appreciation for the love and beauty in my life
a love story not a cancer story There are too many thoughts Rolling around All I can say is this is one of the most beautifully we'll written novels I've ever had the privilege of reading
I really loved this storyeven though it is a difficult subject it was still a good read heartwarming and sad all at the same time I would definitely recommend it to my friends and I have
Exceptionally well written  While this could have been maudlin it was not  It was a celebration of words and thought provoking twists  How lucky we are to have the days we've been granted
Loved this book Even though it doesn't have a happy ending I still loved it  My daughter and I even went to watch the movie  You learn so much more in the book about the characters though
I loved this book I usually don't read unless I have to but I couldn't put this book down I felt connected to the characters and at a few points I did cry I recommend this book to everyone
Its a true love story that makes you fall for everything that happens to them Very sad but worth reading it over and over again I love it My most favorite book Can't wait to see the movie
Wonderful love storyheartbreaking One of the purest interpretations of true love Written in an easy modern way You fall in love with Hazel and Gus as they fall in love with each other
This book was better then I thought it would be I assumed it be very sad and depressing but it was a true love story and makes you appreciate life and the choices you make Highly recommend
This book was really depressing but it was sweet that they helped each other fight their cancer I liked most of the book but the ending was so disappointing I wouldn't recommend this book
Well written for adolescents and adults alike Good take on real family relationships under tremendous stress  with excellent modeling of healthy behaviors Should be required reading for all
As an adult and mother I was hesitant to read this novel about the lives of teens with terminal cancer  Despite the real sadness portrayed there is an inspiring story of love life and loss
I love this book very nice &amp; interesting to read It won't bore you the more you read the more it gets interesting &amp; wouldn't want to stop reading it One of the best books i've read so far
this book is a 5 star book it had humor and disasters but that's what made it unlike any book I have read I wish the ending didn't happen so bad so quick though everything turned out okay
This book was one of my favorite books ever The plot for it was so beautiful and touching It made you want to cry and fall in love with the relationship of Hazel and Augustus LOVED it :-)
I cried when something sad happened to them and smiled when something good happened it's such a great book My friends told me to read this book so I did no regrets can't wait to see the movie
A beautiful love story about to young adults who find each other and are amazing support for one another during a very difficult timeHeart warming tear jerking but well worth the read
It was  pleasure to read a book written by an intelligent author who could create interesting honest dialogue Sad topic that was compelling  Could not stop ready it Ending was a bit weak
This book is just amazing I loved it It took me less than a day to read this because it was impossible to put down Now I have to go see the movie although I do not expect it to be as good
A beautiful mixture of love and loss with a simple reminder of the complexities of being human The characters and their trials felt tangible portraying brilliantly a contemporary love story
Heartfelt and simple Finding beauty in small noticing It's what matters Good start to my summer middle school reading marathon Curious if the movie can do this story justice probably not
I haven't been so emotionally touched and moved by a book in a long time This book made me happy cry and sad cry at the same time The whirl of emotions that Hazel caused me is indescribable
This book has a lot of life lessons that you can learn I feel like I can relate to Hazel I lost an uncle to lung cancer that I was very close to If you want a book to read this is the one
This is one of the best books I have read in awhile very touching and poignant in sharing the lives of two terminally ill teens  Their love story is one to be talked about for years to come
Absolutely amazing great read for those who may sometimes feel unimportant The story isn't about cancer patients its about what love can make people do for another even in their dying days
I chose a 5 star because there is no other love story like this that sucks you in on the first word The title even drags you into it I would recommend this to anyone willing to cry a little
I have never cried and laughed in one book Hazel's and Gus' views on life amaze me I can't wait for the movie to come out although somehow I know the movie will never bring the book justice
So beautiful I cried most of the second part of the book I started this book on a Monday and finished it on Wednesday of the same week I highly recommend it Fantastic Whew what a writer
THIS BOOK WAS AMAZING It had themes many people hadn't thought of and humorously showed the sadness of cancer John Green has yet again allowed you to live and feel as one of the characters
This book has inspired me so much it brought tears and joy to me I read it all in 2 days it was amazing I encourage you to read it any gender can read this too it gives a great message
I read this book twice The characters were fantastic You want to cry and cheer on the characters  It's a book you can't put down I am going to see the movie but the book is always the best
This novel was witty insightful and fun which is odd considering the subject matterThe main character's smart mouth keeps the story of young love thrwarted by cancer from becoming too sappy
This book is amazing I would give it six stars if I could It's so well-written and heartwarming I cried my eyes out the first (and second and third) time I read this book It's so touching
Great book Kind of sad but that was expected since it's about cancer kids It's a love story between two interesting young people giving insight to what it must be like to be a cancer kid
This book will stay with you for a long long time which is precisely why you must read it  It's an glimpse into the lives of three smart strong and vulnerable teens  This is a must read
Writing from a 16 year old's perspective gives the book so much credibility  Wasn't sad or depressing until the end  It gave you a window into how people deal with their illness differently
I can't believe I found humor in a book about teens with cancer and dying but it was an easy and at times delightful read  The characters were real clearly motivated and heart wrenching
love the story and the character i have read this many times very heartwarming  This story absolutely  absorbed me I was completely entertained and deeply touched by The Fault In Our Stars
This was a very quick read and so worth every minute you spend on it  It is beautifully written with great dialog and a touching story about two teenagers  It's a sad but heartwarming story
Excellent Excellent Book It Grabs Your Attention From The beginning And keeps You Reading Kleenix Needed In Spots Our Bookclub Will Be Discussing This One And I Know That It Will Be A Hit
I'm eleven years old and have read many books but I've never yet read a book as well thought of and for lack of a better word amazingI hope you read and enjoy this book as much as I did
Lovely It was totally unexpected and so worth my time It brought up so much emotion and I loved going into this different world This book will be read many times Thank you John Green
This book was funny and heartbreaking all at the same time It teaches you to appreciate the here and now with the people you love while also showing that grief doesn't have to end your life
This novel was able to bring me into the lives of these two lover with incurable diseases I cried and laughed and wondered and loved when they did Such a full and inspiring way to live life
There wasn't anything I disliked about this  book Heartwarming funny sad enlightening I would highly recommend this book to intelligent young people specifically along with everyone else
This book has everything it made me laugh out loud cry unconsoliby John Green is an excellent writer and I bought all of his other books and I am already halfway through looking for Alaska
I absolutely loved everything about this book Everything It doesn't get any better than this Green wraps the reader into every detail of his story gripping you from the very first chapter
This book pulls on your heart strings This book is amazing I always recommend that my friends read this book because it is so good It's a really cute book and I was crying towards the end
this book really makes you think about how faulty our lives are from the beginning hazel and Gus are a perfect match to tell us what life is like when you are on limited time love this book
It was actually a very goof book but (1) the teenagers were using words that teenagers wouldn't use (2) the ending was very expected and stopped very abruptly  But over all it was very good
I would recommend this book Not only is cute and funny but it's sad I couldn't put my kindle down for the two days I had this book bought it grasp you in ways you never thought it would
I have never read such a beautiful book in all of my years I recommend this book to the masses There is no contemplating buying it or if you should read itjust do it it's totally worth it
Was a good story very quick read It was a little depressing but still had a nice ending I felt that some parts could have been expanded to make a longer story a little more detailed maybe
I enjoyed this book It had been recommended to me by a friend and I definitely enjoyed it as a quick beach read It felt like it was written for a younger audience (I'm 28) but entertaining
This book harnesses the power of teen wit and sarcasm with the poignant realities of cancer and disease The dialogue between the two main characters was fantastic I really enjoyed this book
This book doesn't insult  It assumes you are brilliant and looking for brillianceSeven more words requiredI don't have any
Since I'm more of an action/mystery reader this is not my kind of book so the rating is colored by my taste in books  It was something different for me and it was not terrible but not great
This book is wonderfully written You go through all of the emotions Hazel Grace goes through and you can empathize with all of the tragedy in her young life Pain demands to be felt indeed
So poignant and realistic You really feel like you can identify with Hazel and Augustus even if cancer hasn't touched your life As a survivor myself I really appreciated the point of view
I've read hundreds of goods books but this is one of my most FAVORITES I HIGHLY recommendedThis book to anyone who likes romance comedy and so much more I LOVE LOVE LOVE this book
I loved everything about this book It was easy to read yet had words I needed to look up it has love humor  tragedy &amp; perspective Every time I read it I cry And I can't stop reading it
This book was so inspiring I hope I have somebody I love as much as they did in my life I cried at the part where he dies I felt so bad This book is like from 1-10 I give it like a thousand
This book was recommend to me by a couple of family members so I tried by default I ended up reading it all at once followed by the movie Amazing read As always the book is way better
This book was a great read Very enjoyable with a great message about friendshipI would recommend this book to anyone who is interested in friendship in difficult times  stories
I loved this book It was sad but funny and heartfelt Also very well written I loved the characters they were strong in a time when you though they should be weak Loved loved loved it
We can only guess how living with cancer must be like unless one in fact does have cancer This was the poignant tale of two young people with so much life to live who discovered one another
This novel is the best story put into words It is a romantic tragedy that makes you both entertained and interested This novel is the best thing that has happened to this world and the next
I love this book Sometimes your first love is purest Untainted by worldly pain And although these two grew up fast because of their circumstances it sort of made it all the more real
I loved this book I do not normally read books of this genre but I definitely recommend it I was heartbroken to see it end I wanted so much more I could have read it again and again
OMG THIS BOOK IS AMAZING I WILL read this book everyday use love that bookthe resonate I gave it 5 stars because it deserves 5 stars this book is just amazing well done John Green
I write this with tears in my eyes such a sad and beautiful love story about life living and death Everyone young and old should read this bookBut mostly we should enjoy the here and now
overall just an amazing story I fell in love with both hazel and Augustus it was an elegant love story one that you can only wish will happen to you truly a book I will re-read every year
This book was exceptional  Sad funny realistic yet romantic  I had a hard time putting it down  Cancer is a horrible disease but cancer that invades the bodies of the young is a tragedy
I was a little disappointed that this is fiction I was completely believing the thoughts of life and death by a terminal being was anger acceptance and spiritually comforting a good STORY
I think that this book was fantastic with amazing plot twists in every chapter I also know that the movie followed this book very well and that a second boom should be included in this series
This is one of the best books about living while dying I have read The other is Tuesday's with Morrie by Mitch Albom It captures you from the first page and is hard to put down FANTASTIC
This was awesome  Thank goodness for Kindles so I could read and not wake the hubby I could not put it down and even woke up in the middle of the night a couple of nights and kept reading
It was a beautiful story a little sad tho since both of the main characters either had cancer or were living with its consequences but overall its message was full of hope and romantic &lt;3
Having seen it referred to at different places I found it not up to the hypeIt's kinda chick lit n wannabe epic imhoYes good and beautiful in partsMy opinion entirely
I laughed I cried and I couldn't stop reading I loved the way it was written The voices rang so true I felt like I was listening to the words not reading them I hope the movie is as good
I loved this book and read it in two days The characters are well-developed and the story is different and very poignant Glad it was made into a hit movie John Green is an amazing writer
O-M-(freaking) G Best book I've read in a VERY long time At about half way through I couldn't put it down and finished it in 1 1/2 hours  Be prepared to cry lol I will def be rereading
This story was a great read on many levels It's a somber topic but I loved the wit and charm that went with it There are a lot of life lessons to think about as you read between the lines
Five stars because it was a universal message of hope dreams love and redemption Anyone who has ever loved and lost to any fickle disease must read this novel Can't wait to see the movie
If you read this please please have a box of tissues when you get to the end I am going to kill my friend because she told me to read it But I'm glad I did it's so well written  I loved it
A wonderful tale of young love and the hope that blossoms even in the worst of times showing that it's always preferable to be optimistic and make the most of the time one has on this Earth
I knew it was going to be a sad story but it was still a good book I also don't think it's just for young adults I have been an avid reader of all types of books and I am almost 60 Enjoy
Great witty banter between Hazel and Augustus Loved the development of the characters I do wish I wasn't able to predict the book about midway through till the end Still a great easy read
I love books that make you feel the pain of the characters I felt I could cry the tears and laugh the laughs because Green does a great job at portraying their feelings Fabulous book
This is an amazing love story It has a really strong message I would recommend it to anyone interested in romances or sappy books This definitely had me teary eyed Well done John Green
One of the most beautifully written books i have read in yearsThought provoking funny tender and sadif you read one book this year - let it be The Fault in our Stars
The book was okay in the sense that Augustus and Hazel meant It's a beautiful story and I don't quite know the proper review to write that would fully encompass how much I enjoyed the story
Fast reading this is the kind of book where you get to the last chapter and want to stop reading because you don't want a really good book to end This is definitely one of my favorites now
Wonderful insight into the thinking of young people dealing with tragic suffering The dialogue rings true to life One of my favorite reads of the past few years Could not put the book down
What I most liked about this book was how it increased my understanding of the lives of young people as well as their parents as they face cancer Enlightening and poignant yet not nostalgic
OKAY no I didn't cry I have this odd thing that I can't cry during sad things in books or TV shows Anyway it is an AMAZING book The story line the characters EVERYTHING FYI it is sad
This book was amazing Absolutely amazing I have no words to describe the utter perfection of this amazing book It changed my life and the way I look upon things nowOkayOkay
This book is extraordinary It gives me a whole to meaning to this world and  i look at it now the way that hazel Grace and Augustus waters did Do not pass  up this book It will Change you
This book was amazing It wrenched my heart right out of my chest It made me cry laugh scream and smile It was truly an amazing read I can't believe it ended I could read so much more
This great story I mean let's say diary is amazing I don't even know how much I learned from this love story thanks John Green for writing this book and I hope your not like Van Houten
Overall I would recommend this book Obviously a tear jerkerbut a little predictable The writing was excellent and I plan to read more John Green hopefully without the awkward teenagers
Fault in Our Stars was a quick read I couldn't put it down Thinking it was about teens who have cancer I thought it would be depressing On the contrary it had humor and was very uplifting
I'm probably the last person in the country to catch on to the John Green bandwagon Great story well written excellent characters Well donealthough I imagine he already knows that ;)
How can I say it was a good book when the subject is Cancer--and teen Cancer at that Actually it is a love story but so painfulWell written but I prefer to be oblivious to such pain
I loved this book so much I did cry a lot  But it was worth it i love John green so much  And I highlighted so many quotes it unbelievable But I loved this book more than life itself
I originally read this a couple years ago for an MFA Program in YA Creative Writing and just re-read it in anticipation of the upcoming movie GREAT storytelling from a very talented author
I've read numerous books since this one so I've already forgotten a lot of what I loved  But I remember loving the relationship and the touching realness to the emotions the characters had
Best book I have ever read hands down I love how this made me filled me with so much emotion I was literally up until 2am crying because of this book I recommend that everyone reads this
This book was the best I've  ever read I cried and this book is happy sad and everything  in between  I loved  it Im still always requesting this book to others  And they have to read  
I don't normally read young adult but my book club recommended this oneI was quite surprised  The book was very well written though a very tough subjectmatter I did indeed cry
This was all the rage in school I picked it up and started reading it I couldn't put it down Such a beautiful story and I can't wait for the movie Definitely recommend thisto everyone
This book led me into the world of cancer patients and I am so glad I read it Green is a literary genius and has a way of inspiring me through his writing I will forever remember this book
I cried and laugh while reading this book I think this should be a required book for all High School students to readThey  would get allot more out of this book than most Amazing
Great book  Although supposed to be for a young adult audience it was well written and I actually felt it should be for a bit of a more mature audience given the subject matter of the book
Emotionally exhausting You feel like you've run a marathon after reading this book I loved every word of every page but don't know that I would recommend  unless one just loves the torture
As a physician I am always a little skeptical of books about people struggling with major illness  I am skeptical because I find most books about illness are about that and nothing more -- the characters never become anything more than their disease  Which is why I was so pleasantly surprised by this book  Whenever I recommend this book to friends I try to explain It's a book about teenagers with cancer but its not really about the cancer at all  I think the book is so heartfelt because the character feel like people to me first and cancer patients distant secondAlthough the book is technically written for young adults people of all ages will be able to appreciate John Green's talent for words and wit  I found the only times that I wanted to put this book down were when I needed to write down a quote here or a passage there that I didn't want to forget  There are lines in this book that are worth remembering  Lines that will stick with you  This is John Green's best work to date and a great read for both young adults and not-so-young-adults alike
This book was clearly meant for an adolescent audience Cheap emotional tripe I  sure it was written with the focus of what he could sell
The Fault In Our Stars is phenomenal and I don't mean that in a lame fangirly way it really is a fantastic book that captures what it means to be a teenager to be a girl and I can only assume to have cancer The book manages to depict Hazel Grace Lancaster a sixteen year old girl who happens to have cancer as a smart girl who is dying of cancer who does not hold all the mystical secrets of the meaning of life- she is a normal girl who is pissed off that her life is being cut short Hazel and consequently Augustus Waters' journey is full of joy and tears but it is not a picturesque love as the traditional cancer book would have it- nobody dies in the arms of the person they love there is no fighting together there is only Hazel reliant on pharmaceutical drugs and the scheduled draining of the fluid in her lungs to keep her alive Augustus with his one point four legs and An Imperial Affliction John Green's latest novel is honestly a great book- buy it read it make your friends read it He even signed the whole first printing for us DFTBA
It starts out on a sad note so it's been hard to get past that  I'm usually someone who enjoys non-fiction better so that could also be why I am struggling with getting through this book
Awesome book to read  Helps you understand how the characters feel and makes you feel what they do  Extremely sad  though  The love story is really great and very unique Overall amazing
I didn't want to read about cancer but it pulled me in immediately to the story Kept my interest completelybut was depressing to me that they didn't seem to have hope but why should they
Two youngsters battle deadly disease They experience more of life and love than many who have much longer lives and more opportunities Their time together will warmand wring your heart
The measure of a book IsI believe  the effect it has on the reader A paradigm of life death love and the struggle to achieve them We are all terminal we need to live with that in mind
The best worse book I've ever read I'm in awe of the insight to a world so many fear I would recommend to everyone as everyone should at least acknowledge such aperson such a love story
The characters are completely the stars of the book Each one is so distinct and becomes a part of you that you laugh and cry with them all  By far the best book I have read in a long time
Very compelling My granddaughter read the first 2 chapters to me in the car and then I bought the book on my kindle and read it in 2 days Now I'll see if the movie stays true to the book
Could not put this book down Seeing the view of one who's life is determined day to day makes you see more of the small things that make up the universe and appreciate life for what it is
From the opening page I loves this book and although sad in a number of ways it also shows how in the most terrible circumstances life can provide a silver lining Off to watch the film now
This book gives insight to the real feelings of cancer kids Makes you sad anyone has to endure that but very realistic It's entertaining not all sad Read it now You'll be glad you did
One gives five stars not so often Or shouldn't perhaps I adored this books humor and sensitivity to being realWell developed characters and thought provoking take on death and life
A well written read this book is filled with moments that make you smile but as many that about make your cry I think everyone wishes they knew an Augustus but only some are so privileged
This book reminded me of why I love reading  John Green has a gift for making his intelligent characters perfectly imperfect  This is by far one of the best books I've read in a long time
In this amazing book it shows how love can be eternal It is beautifully written and put me on the edge of my seat I usually hate books but for this book I couldn't put it down Great job
Inspiring great read for  all thinking and feeling people everywhere  It reminds me how important it is to be considerate and kind  We truly never know what another person is living with
this book shows the reality of life and some side effects of dying I recommend reading this not ill read it to say I read it no actually read it take in each word each name each story
Such a sweet and tender love story that it's irrestible  I wanted to read the book before I go to the movie  This was especially poignant for me because of a personal experience of cancer
This book was so heart felt I was literal on a journey with the individuals represented in this book A must read amazing love story on top of it all Take advantage of your circumstances
A well written story that is relatable to everyone I enjoyed refreshing my vocabulary as well as appreciating a love story will an inevitable ending Who knew teenagers were so enlightening
It was sometimes disappointing Not always believable with how Van Houten just showed up But good in the way the big questions of life are addressed by these young characters facing cancer
I loved everything about this book it was a real plot twister I watched the movie when it came out and now I'm reading the book for the second time and I still cried I love this book
Great read couldn't put down The two teenagers in this novel were grappling with death in a bittersweet way and come together as friends in a fasinating novel Can't wait to see the movie
I LOVE this book It made me laugh it made me cry all over the course of 26 hours This book was impossible to put down and beautifully written I would recommend this book to ANYONE
I love how this book was written with a certain aesthetic and intelligence You rejoice with the characters just as you mourn with and feel for them As sad as it was it was just beautiful
I liked this book but it is very touching and emotional if you have ever had or known anyone with cancer  Cried the last 3 chapters-make sure you have your kleenexes when reading this one
Thought provoking and heart warming Made me think about whether I appreciate the number of infinities in my life I love the way Hazel and Augustus interact with each other Well written
I loved how the characters in this book especially Hazel and Gus are so honest The definitely changed my take on life and being in love Love is a promise I recommend this book strongly
It got right into the lives of these two lovers and beautifully told their love story I'd recommend this read to anyone who is looking to see love from different perspectives Lovely story
This is one book I will read over and over again Carry tissues with you because you WILL cry especially in the last 4 chapters I cried while reading this book in my son's taekwondo class
Well written beautiful story about the realities of cancer and the love that can come from it It's about love sacrifice empathy - it's such a wonderful read Reader beware: you will cry
This book tugs at your heart strings - makes me realize how difficult it is for a person to be so sick not knowing what the next day would bringThis book is highly recommended
I love this book It's so touching and humorous at the same timethis book will always be my favorite I would love to thank john green to bringing this book to the world and sharing it
Don't get me wrong this wasn't a bad read by any means but it didn't own up to all the hype  Maybe it's just me  I tried so hard to love this story but I just couldn't get that into it
OMG I loved every word in this book It was very touching and it wasn't just one of those books it was a book you remembered and thought about even when you weren't reading it I loved it
I also have cancer I saw the trailer of the movie and decided to read this story it's an amazing book makes me realize it will do more than die one day I recommend definitely worth reading
My daughter introduced this book to me I think this is a wonderful book for evryone I work as a nurse and I feel like it really depicts how patients really feel  It's a good book read it
can imagine how death and dying hit a teen  the teen who isn't even old enough to know that they are not invincible yet not a weepy book as you would expect  really enjoyed the quick read
The sarcastic humor that the author uses to express the opinions of these understandably jaded teenagers makes adults put their thoughts on life death and what comes next into perspective
This book really made me realize that it's not about the quantity of people of whoms lives you change it's about the quality you bring into the lives of the people you surround yourself with
This story is for the sixteen year old and the sixty year old  I recommend reading the book BEFORE seeing the film (out in July)  The reader will live inside the pages until the last word
Great love story with superb depiction of the reality of day to day dealing with cancer and how it effects every part of your lifebut how life and good and everyday things still go on
I gave this 5 stars because of the uniqueness of this novel It's not one of those books where an  has cancer falls in loveand dies Just read it and you will see exactly what I mean
Such an easy read and non stop excitement I recommend it to everyone A little more perspective on how people with cancer deal with life I cried hysterically  Happy tears and sad tears
This book made me cry a total of about 3 times and 765872 almost times My friend made me read this and I am between absolutely hating her for it and wanting to go and buy her dinner for it
This book was excellent It wasn't the typical cliche love story it was unique in its own way I felt like I knew the characters personally I cryed my eyes out Can't wait to see the movie
This book is AMAZING Sad but amazing The words and the characters everything about it touches my heart Tears came to my eyes in several parts of the book  I can not wait for the movie
I loved this book I loved that it was raw real and full of wit I loved the character's sense of humor and how they viewed the world Heartbreaking and so fulfilling all at the same time
I give 5 stars because this book makes u laugh smile and cry and cry harder Was a very fast read for me because I couldn't put it down I recommend to all ages to read Beautiful story
It was recommended to me and of course I wanted to read before seeing the movie  I liked how it depicted from the perspective of a teenager going through cancer/treatments/acceptance  etc
This book will bring you through an array of emotionsbut ultimately leaves you feeling a great appreciation for life and love and the realization that life is unpredictable
Such a good book‚Ä¶broke my heart but so good Written really well - did not read at all like a YA novel I was thoroughly engrossed and I'm just about twice the age of the main characters
so I decided to read the book  the book was not terrible but it was not amazing either however it was a nice easy read a little slow at first  the end is touching my eyes watered a bit
Very thought provoking and well written  This book really moved me  The characters were so believable and the author did an excellent job of making the reader understand the circumstances
A slow start but a tear jerker through the end Amazing perception of teenagers fighting the one thing we never want to experience Down to earth take on humor and sadness Highly recommend
Great read The book read like a breeze but still engaging There are moments in the book where they take you to places internally and you have to put it down to reflect Highly Recommended
It's been a long time since a book made me cry This dynamic novel is a must read for anyone young/ old  or boy/ girl I never put this one down I had to know what was going to happen next
I don't know what else to say john green you complete me This book was amazing and really made me fall in love with the characters and I cannot wait until June to see it on the big screen
This was a good book It was thoughtful entertaining and a quick read  I would recommend it to others  I did not give in more stars because it was good not mind-blowing but I enjoyed it
I actually read that book because I saw a couple tattoo I didn't understand  Okay OkayI loved it from the first pages was about to cry at the endIt's one awesome lecture :)
A quirky ya book about two kids that fall in love I laughed and cried If a book can evoke such a strong reaction I have to give it five stars I will recommend this book to everyone I see
This boom is a heart touching novel that could make any reader cry It teaches one that they aren't the only one with a problem in the world I recommended this book for anyone with a heart
John Green is an artist He really portraits the book in ways that has made me really emotional I'm a 15 year old guy- who cried That says a lot I love this book  everyone should read it
I loved this book  It was a wonderful yet painful story of young love and early death  My 15 year old grandson recommended this book to me and I'm very grateful  I thoroughly enjoyed it
Poignant and philosophical; this book may be my favorite read of the summer  A story of young love between cancer patients I knew it would end badly but it was a funny and insightful trip
This book was a quick read that sucked you in right from the beginning The characters are endearing and you think about them while you aren't reading :) Read it you will be happy you did
This was a very deep soul moving story I have to say that I wasn't expecting this book to be that good Now I guess I'll watch the movie and we'll seeRead it No waste at all
This book is amazing It's an awesome love story and a story of true strength I experienced so many different emotions reading this book All I have to say is you will not be disappointed
I've read this book many times and each time I read it it gets even better than the previous time It is definitely a book that I would recommend to teenagers and adults A wonderful read
This book had great humor despite the situation  It was a great book a little short but still a lot happens I would recommend it to anyone looking for a book that makes you laugh and cry
I almost stopped reading after the first few pages but very glad I did not  I take my health for granted sometimes even though I have MS (which is in remission) Very emotional and honest
The author fully represents the human Condition of death comes to us all but much sooner for some You are fully emerced in these characters and the beauty of their small fragile existence
This was an easy read due to the fact you are swept along their journey of dying with them I couldn't put this down but when I did I kept thinking about what will happen next A good read
A real tear jerker what more can i say  three brilliant teenagers with a vocabulary i could only dream of having that's the only thing that threw me off  unless really do talk that way
It was a good book  Nothing out of this world but definitely a sweet story  I love the twist to characters‚Ä¶they all have a lot of character‚Ä¶they are not your typical everyday characters
John Green is an absolutely fabulous writer This is my favorite book ever Even though it is about cancer which is a hard topic to realistically write about he did it perfectly 5 stars
I enjoyed the book I hate books that end though The timing of the ending never satisfies Very well written Very funny At some points I literally laughed uncontrollably at the imagery
I Loved itthe whole metaphorically Raw written story of love and cancer You get to honestly view the world through someone elses eyeseyes that you wish will never become your own
It was a nice idea and there were parts that made me smile but it didn't win me over at all I read this book because of all the hype but I could have passed it by and not missed a thing
I cannot belive you are such a good writer and in only A book I cried I am sure the book is better but I am dying to the the movie I now have a crusg on Augustus Waters AKA Ansel Elgort
The dialogue and the characters in this book kept me reading The story seems like it should be sad but because of the characters' strengths I wouldn't rate it as such An inspiring read
I am in love with this book I immediately fell in love with the characters I could not put the book down I have so much more to say about this amazing book but it would never end‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è
As a cancer survivor I thought I would have a hard time reading this but in fact it presented a perspective that I found reassuring An 'easy' read but well written an thought provoking
Going to watch the movie later but only because I have falling in love with Hazel and Augustus This is a must read but don't forget the tissues as you will need them for this epic story
I loved this book but it made me sad It's a true love story but instead has a twist of cancer and that stinks  I hope many people will read this book and feel something after reading it
When I finished this book I was sad but I realized the young man brought his girlfriend out into the world  She had been so alone before she met him  That helped me get over the sadness
Cleverly written tender coming of age love story Although the target audience is teens and young adults my book club of moms with teens and young adults loved it Have your tissues handy
I would recommend reading this book to gain insight and new perspective for people with life threatening sickness  This story gave me new ways to appreciate life every second we are given
I loved this book I loved the characters and the plot and the bits of humor mixed in The writing and the character development in this book is great I couldn't put it down LOVED IT
Not a fan of love stories but after the many advertisements on tv about this love story curiosity got me to read it  It is a medical love story which will keep you reading and not crying
I love every single part of this bookHazel and Augustus had a love that I'm unable to describe  This book had me in tears more than 1 timeI look forward to seeing the movie
From that metaphorical bastard the love-struck blind guy to that girl with cancer living her life This book is a great heart breaking romance story that will make you break down in sods
Loved it all Very honest take on death Death is not beautiful or warm It's the perfect representation of the pain of being outside of the presence of God It is not fairand it stings
John Green captured the essence of true love I fell in love with the characters and stoped reading only long enough to wipe the tears away from my eyes definitely a worth while read
Oh my I cried I loved the writing style  and story was hard to read The love between Gus and Hazel is the kind we can only get once in our lifetimes no matter the length of time we live
A good book  Very heart felt and makes you look at your life  The characters were easy to get attached to  Easy read but will cause you to be saddened at events that become in the story
This is a phenomenal book and great read / listen If you have 8 hours in some form to listen to a book this is one worth listening to  At some point in your lifeGod bless
I really loved this book I read it 2 days because I just couldn't put it down I don't even know what to say about it except that people really should read it because it is an amazing book
This is a love story like no other This book really makes you think we don't know how much time we have here To be in love at least once in our short lives is the greatest gift ever
John Green has full grasp of my attention with this book John Green used great enfaces to show that the characters truly cared about enjoying what could be the last moments of their lives
I chose this rating because this book is real The story is made up but it tells the truth It makes you understand people living with cancer in a different way a good way the way it is
The agony of disease met with humor and reality The chemistry between the main characters jumps off the pages and pulls you into a story about humanity in a raw state of illness and death
This book opened my eyes to both life and death and love An eye opener I needed To remind me to not waste the precious time I have on this earth but to live it Even if I feel like dying
Maybe I'm a soulless jerk but I found this book to be really predictable  I did finish it and while I don't regret reading the entire book I definitely wouldn't recommend it to a friend
Well written quick read realistic  This book grabs your attention and pulls at your heart along the waytouching moving story about the horrific journey cancer brings to so many people
This is a great book although very sad I haven't cried reading a book in a long time and I sat on the couch this morning crying like a baby  I hope the movie does this great book justice
This story is the absolute saddest i will ever read It has twist to the story i never saw coming If anyone doesn't like the story then they are mad i give it a billion stars**** :) :) 
I absolutely loved this book So honest and so touching I should have known better than to read this but then I would not have experienced this amazing book BAWLED my eyes out at the end
Didn't enjoy this book very much  It was very dark and dealt with death  I skimmed over a lot of it because it just wasn't interesting to me and I did not appreciate some of the language
I absolutely love this book I am not a reader at all But once I picked up this book I could not put it down As emotional as it is I loved it And I will read it as many times as I want
I loved this book because the writing was spectacular but tragic endings don't work out I think this is a good book but do not start if you like happy endings because you will be hooked
I CRIED MANY TEARS I highly recommend this story for anyone to read I believe that this story deserves all the buzz it it getting and i hope that you don't have any regrets reading this
I'm typically not into romantic love story type books but thisthis is different I couldn't put it down There's a few twists and turns and it's pretty sad but also delightfully perfect
I know this book is written for young adults but as a not so young adult women I really enjoyed this book It was smart and heartfelt I would recommend this book to anyone at any age
I read this book on a recommendation of a friend since the movie is coming out  I loved it  Especially the point of view the book is written  It doesn't sugar coat anything  Great read
All I can say is that I love love this book It's full of life and love It's brilliant It's touching and it brought tears to my eyes  Not only that it opened my eyes Live Love Laugh
This book is AMAZING the writing is wonderful and the plot will make you cry Hazel and Gus' love story is one that will pull at your heart and make you cry every time you read it-MK
And I'm not even kidding Probably the most serious of John Green's novels which is of course still quite hilarious A welcome relief is that it doesn't feature a Manic Pixie Dream Girl
Great story about life and love The characters were well developed and fascinating I read this for a book club and every one unanimously loved it Made for some great discussions as well
Beautifully written heart wrenching story an absolute must-read I purchased this book for my kindle after hearing about the movie's upcoming release and now can't wait to see the movie
A tough subject handled beautifully  Thought provoking well written I could picture every character as they were strongly created  It was a gentle honest look into real life Loved it
This really is the most amazing book i have ever read Such details and feelings Its remarkable and anybody interested in romance and adventure and life is most certain to read this 
A very different and inspiring novel The story of hazel grace has changed my life forever it made me think about what I am in control of and what I am not Definitely one of my favorites
I like  this book a lot I sorta liked it's tragic but still meaningful ending I think it was fantastic So I would like to thank my mother for making me read it- Eva age 11
This was such a good book I cried but I couldn't put it down I usually go to sleep around 10 but I stayed up until 1 reading it and couldn't stop thinking about it at work the next day
this is an amazing love story told in an unbelievable way the love these two have for each other in such a short time is above you could only hope to be in your whole entire life amazing
I can't believe it ended when it did I wasn't ready It is going to take some time to recover I am thoroughly impressed heartbroken and hopeful Incredible Stunning Loved every second
It is hard to explain what I liked and didn't like about this book without giving away details about the story  But it is a different point of view than usually written about  A good read
This is a romance yet it's also a peek into the thoughts of teens diagnosed with different forms of cancer Makes you realize just how normal we areeven with a life shortening illness
I have cried so many times reading this book the only regret I have is not reading it before seeing the movie I am very happy with this book and am now moving to another John Green book
This book was an amazing heart warming story that made me want to read mire by John Green If you loved this book I recommend reading paper towns beside it will make you feel the same way
This is a honest  and well written book I enjoyed the quirky and interesting characters experiencing the average teenage obstacles yet with a maturity far exceeding the average teenager
Finally got up the courage to read this book and it did not disappoint Cancer doesn't discriminate and it takes everything you have  But you still want love and respect Incredible read
This book gave me goosebumpsI couldnt put it downit was very unpredictable absolutely loved it and haven't been able to find a book to read after thisGus Waters is my hero
It's cute it's fun it's happy it's sad it's strangely profound and it makes you think in ways you might not have otherwiseIt doesn't feel like filler; I'm glad I read it
I really liked the book because it was a love story mixed in with teenage drama and adult content If I had to use two words to describe the book I would use heartwarming and heartbreaking
One of the best books I've read in a very long time Heartbreaking insightful funny/smart dialogue I give my sisters my favorite book of the year It's this book this year Hands down
It was a great book but when Augustus died for me it was not described very well and I don't know why others were crying their eyes out Other than that I liked it and it was fun to read
Augustus' humor reminds me of my husband's So goofy even if he was going through a terrible time Very excellent love story through all the tears and inspiration I thank you John Green
Well written fast ready truly enjoyed Keep the kleenex handy Good reminder that individual with such serious diagnoses are not all doom &amp; gloom and would enjoy a little comedy relief
Buyer was fine my daughter was not thrilled with the book she found it not as engaging as she thought it would be 50% of her friends loved it  50% not so much so this is a style thing
This book was touching intelligent and a beautiful insight into a world I have only scrapped the surface of  I never wanted it to end This is something I will read over and over again
I give very few books 5 stars but this one has earned them  John Green shows us the thoughts and feelings of people who have cancer that the Cancer free could never understand otherwise
This is Tiffany not Nate  I wanted to read this before watching the movie and now I am not sure I want too because I don't think they can due the book justice This book is a great read
There are some really poignant parts in this book  It definitely had me thinking about a lot for good and for bad I would not read it again because it didn't ring completely true for me
This book was so sad and this book is AWESOME At this  point it is my favorite book The mixture of sad and hopeful made this book bitter sweet however in the end more sweet than bitter
This book is interesting I unlike other people did not cry at this book I understand the book But I need not write more since this review will be buried under all the sappy comments
Although I was stunned and saddened by the unexpected the entire story keeps the reader engaged and hopeful  In life we cannot always choose the outcome but we choose how to make a path
Sweet story a bit predictable and sometimes sophomoric but overall a good read for young teens I'm looking forward to taking my niece to the movie But she is required to read it first
Great read Have worked with many kids that are terminally ill and the strength they show is amazing They live life to the fullest  They make you want to be a better and stronger person
This book left me speechless I could not put it down It will definitely make you cry but it will also make you smile Very we'll written Can't wait to see if the movie does it justice
One of the best books I have ever read Very well written while reading this book I had so many emotions: happy sad funny and more I would definitely recommend this book to anyone
This is a book you cannot put down It is a book that keeps you intrigued at all times and everybody will love I can say that it is by far my favorite book even though years are involved
I was starting to think I didn't like reading anymore because I couldn't seem to get through a book But I tore through this one Now time to see the movie I'm positive it doesn't compare
I'd recommend this book to anyone with a heart I grew incredibly attached to the characters Everyone should read this It's very blunt and honest and makes you feel a rush of emotions
It was a romantic love story that usually isn't found in a cancer story It is a very unique book to find Everyone shod read because this is a very usual predicament found in this world
This was a book I read after seeing the movie Did not disappoint on either account There of course were details left out of the movie that were in the book but that is to be expected
I loved this story It is hopeful at the same time that it is tragic without being overly sentimental I love the story without an ending within the story also really without an ending
It has been a struggle to get my daughter to read and stay interested in books  She read this book in less than a week  She loved it and her friends who have read it have also loved it
I saw the commercial for the movie and I told my friend I was watching it they insisted I read the book first this book is probably the best book ever shows the real meaning of true love
I hope the movie does it great justiceI cried the whole last half of the book a good cry but a long cry can't wait to read it again I think this will be my an imperial affliction
This book it absolutely amazing It gets you thinking about life in different ways it is hard to put down and you get so involved with the main charter I recommend this book to everyone
Loved the book Should have expected the Gus twist but it caught me off guard I also thought something was wrong with my phone and kept looking for 20 more pages Then it all made sense
Let's just say this book is amazing It definitely deserves 5 stars It is a very sweet happy book until some parts The only thing I would have changed in this book would be how it ends
This book is an emotional rollercoaster and will make you laugh and cry I was reading a sad part and cried at the store I got strange looks from people But overall it's an amazing book
The book was so great and well written It would be five stars but I am saving my five star ratingIt was great to read a book that had a true appreciation for words and literature
I read this book quickly I knew when I bought it that it was going to be emotional but it wrapped me in so quickly I had to see it through Good book Sad though But obviously too true
One of the best books I've ever read It will have you laughing and crying throughout but such a great book The way it is written makes you feel like you are part of the story being told
Yes the main male character is pretentious It's his way of coping Yes the book is cheesy It makes fun of itself But this was one of the best book I have ever read And it made me cry
This book will shake you to the core if you have ever lost someone you deeply loved It reminds us that the pain of love and loss are inescapable for mere humans  but worth it all anyway
This book was quite a surprise  I thought it would be a real downer kids with cancer  But it's well written and looks at what we all want out of life  How do you want to be remembered
He captured love friendship and how small we are as human beings In one book he managed to make me remember that falling in love is easy but losing someone is an adventure all in itself
Great book  I kept hearing how good it was but put off reading it because I knew a bit about it  I finally broke down and once I started it I wanted to keep reading it  Very well done
Great storytelling and enticement by the protagonistscommissions compassion &amp; pulls on the heart stringsintellectually savvy as well One to read over and over to catch the nuances
I am in love with this book   At first I wasn't going to read it because it was about cancer but I read it and I was pleasantly surprised  I totally recommend this book
This book was truly amazing You know from the beginning that the book is going to be sad but it is also funny and had whit You never lose interest in it by far the best book I've read
I decided to read this book based on all the hype but I was completely disappointed in it It was a struggle to read all the way through I found the characters annoying and hard to like
But so glad to have arrived I enjoyed thus book thoroughly and understand now why Mr Green is so popular with the students that I work with Looking forward to reading more of his work
I have read this beautiful story multiple times and it never ceases to amaze It falls in the young adult fiction genre but is really an amazing story to be appreciated by all age groups
This book in its TV- movie elegance is quite wonderful The characters are too wise too smart and just perfect This book is a simple nugget of joy and sadness and deserves to be read
This is a YA novel It has terrific heart and a wonderful set of characters (and the parents aren't made to be completely stupid) I laughed out loud - and of course cried through the end
Fantastic book  Love it
I loved this book It was witty and interesting and even though it wanted to be sad it didn't allow you too it was just about Hazel and Augustus and their love not about death and sadness
Another one of John Green's books that I absolutely was engrossed until the end The story had the biggest twist that I was expecting a little but not in that sad and horrific portrayal
Love it John green u need to write more just like this maybe even a sequel but that would be hard without Augustus maybe a new boy came to town named MichaelOnce again love the book
What a story  I recommend it - it's not just for teenagers  People complain about so many things that often are unnecessary  This book will make you think twice before being negative
I knew from page 24 that my eyes would hate me by the end of the book and my nose would be a red and raw But this was such a beautiful witty funny and grounding book Love love love
I started to read this book in 2012 after my daughter passed away of a heart defect and finally finished it two years later worth every minute I wish every love story was this sincere (:
Chick's book But a nice story though I'd preferred to watch only the movieTo be fair I strongly suggest to all women They will love it But not as much for straight men
the  book although sad was well written and believable  I  enjoyed it  If I hadn't not known  it was written  by a male I  would  have though  that a young teen woman  had  wrote it
Incredibly painful and sadincredibly uplifting Oh did I say how incredible this book is John Green I am now a fan and will be reading more of your books Thank you for the experience
Very good book  Bought this because I wanted to read it before I saw the moving  Now I have to go see the movie  I'd been told by others it was a great book and I wasn't disappointed
This is one of those books that you think about long after you finish The story moves at a great pace the characters are very well developed and i really enjoyed it Truly a great read
I'll give it 5 stars it's my first John Green book and definitely not the last I think this book speaks the truthit has everything lovelaughter paindeath and that's the way life is
I have no first hand experience but I imagine this to be as close as it gets to looking inside the lives of families and cancer sufferers  I will work harder to feel grateful every day
We should all get the chance to have a pure love as Hazel and Gus had They made every minute count They were very smart for a couple of sick kids They lived there lives while each day
Amazing story A story I am not used to in my readings Buy I'm glad that I was introduced to this wonderful literary work It is smart funny and yet tragic in a delightful way Love it
What a phenomenal piece of work I was crying but kept on reading Glad to have known Hazel and Gus But what happens to Hazel now Do I need to get in touch with Van HoutenAhamed
This was a book about two incredibly vital and brave people who fell in love and found joy despite that crap hand they were dealt it made me laugh and cry and I loved every second of it
John does a beautiful job of allowing the readers to feel as if they are intimately involved with the characters You feel their pain as well as their joy An absolute privilege to read
This book unlike most books used reality as a focal point It did not create this fake world fantasy that make people wish for reality to be like fantasy I loved this book it is amazing
It brought me happy thoughts and dreams that I hope I will remember forever It has also brought sadness upon me but that I feel is expected in a good book I highly recommend this book
It takes a real writer to be able to punch you in the face with words and even know it hurts I would still tell everyone I know to read it because its a great book and it's worth the time
Simply put I loved it Love it  Can't write much about The Fault in our Stars because I can barely see through the tears It's a wonderful must read I have to give it five stars Thanks
too good a story to even write the words that would do it justice beautiful I hope it was a work of fiction because it is too sad to know there was an Augustus or Hazel Grace out there
This book caused one to see and feel emotions/thoughts that are not typically delved into It was sad but inspirational Loved that Van Houten was brilliant complicated and very troubled
Good book a bit of a twist a major tear jerker My daughter saw me reading with years streaming down my face and asked what was wrong You connect with the characters and feel for them
This was the first book I had read by this author but was not disappointed by all the hype he and his books have gotten A poignant book about something I hope I never have to deal with
I cannot put into appropriate words the depth of emotions that surfaced while engaged in this heart wrenching story I loved it but recommend that it not be read without a box of tissue
This book is VERY touching and heartwarming Everybody should read this book and I can only imagine how well written the other books are written This book is to be read by EVERYONE:)
My daughter says I have no words to describe the fault in our stars other than saying no other book compares to it's genius I literally spent the last half hour balling my eyes out
Some people are saying the teens are unbelievablebut remember they don't get outsidemuch this was tithe best book I read and Im like crying my brainsout and everything good day sir by
My niece had me read this book as she loves to read as much as me  I love this book and am looking forward to move  I liked John Green writing I also am reading his other books as well
This book has a story that melted my heart and made me realize a lot about the world and the whole love story with Augustus and Hazel was adorable and perfect Love this book sososo much
A true teen love storyforget Twilight Deep real smart kids dealing with real life and death Finally a raise in the standards of YA literature  Top that teams Edward and Jacob
I've never cried in a book and I found myself bawling several times It was hard to stop reading and I finished in about 3 days and I even hate romance type books/movies Super good read
I didn't cry but It got me right in the feels Really good story though A couple words flew over my head but it's probably because I'm not very well educated in the medical department
This book was beautifully written My brother had leukemia as a child and this was such an accurate portrayal of the whole family My brother is healthy and in remission for 30 years now
Reading this book makes you think more about life and how precious it is How can you not cry when reading this It's impossible John Green kind of pulled a Van Houten about Hazel Grace
This book was recommended to me and I saw that soo many people liked it so I read it  Kind of dissapointing it was a decent read - the flow went well but it was freaking depressing lol
This book is a very good story that give very realistic ideals into the death and dying process for teens and their family It made me laugh and cry at points Can't wait to see the movie
This book kept both my 14 year old and 17 year old busy reading  Both finished the book within 2 days and have told me I need to read it  I love when my kids are into reading like that
Very intelligent book Sad but real Loved it and would recommend it I'm the type that has to read the boo before seeing the movie because often times the movie is changed in some way
After reading this book I was completely in love with Hazel and was moved by Augustus and her romance even through their situations My only advice is to read it with a box of tissues
Even though this book is slated young adult it was such an in depth emotional story It was hard for me to put it down and in fact I didn't put it down but stayed up until 2am to finish
I thoroughly enjoyed this book despite the fact that it was sad at times  Best for anyone who has ever been in love and/or had a family member or friend diagnosed with a terminal illness
Captivated by Hazel and Augustus' story The way it was writtenthis is an absolutely beautiful book For appreciating and finding the best in the worst circumstances is truly glorious
Very well written One of the most moving books I have ever read My favorite character was Augustus for his unpredictable nature and the way he loved life just for the sake of living it
I cried my way through but loved every page  If you want a book you'd like to read in one day with characters you feel you know and so much to think about when you're done Read this
This book kept me entertained but why I really gave it five stars; it played with so many emotions This chair gripping book made my eyes tear through each page holding on to each word
all I have to say is its perfection and he did the say thing that happened to hazel when she wanted to know what happened to the rest of Anna's family I want to know what happens to hazel
This book begins a little slow and the characters make you think that this is going to be a depressing book  It is sad at one point but not what I would have thought at all  I loved it
I kept hearing about this  After reading it I can see why the big dealA great read a touching storyI just want it to be a movie now just so I can cry all over again
You need to read this fricken book It is so good Beware though you will laugh cry and feel like the characters in this book are your family I loved it so much that I'm sad it ended
Powerfully poignant and hopeful glimpse at mere mortals learning to live and love while staring premature mortality in the face Never cease to be amazed by the power of the human spirit
I usually do not read books like this  I generally steer clear from a book that has sad/depressing subject matter but this book reeled me in  Please read this  bookyou will love it
The title of this review is an oxymoron because I felt it was deep enough to at least come close to accurately representing this bookLet me start by saying this book is a tear jerker but meaning full and definitely a good oneIts more challenging then most things I've read (I'm 14) but I really enjoyed it It challenges you enough to make you really think about life death everything in between and if there really is much in betweenor if it even mattersThe main characters are unusual and peculiar but they make you laugh Not cheap humour but pure unadulterated comedy Yet it still manages to portray serious topics in a way that makes you really careThe book has a spectacular plot Unique and extremely creative Rich with love and honestly creating a characters life that makes you marvel at the depth of some peoples (John Greens)imaginationTo put it simply I loved it but I cannot describe it accurately  It wouldn't sound right You must simply read it and form your own opinion 
John Green has a new fan  He was able to give the characters intelligent and mature voices while simultaneously maintaining their youth and innocence  I have no idea how he was able to strike such a perfect balance but I loved every word of the dialogue between Hazel and Gus  I believed them and I believed in their love  This book is truly a gem  My husband asked me what it was about and didn't quite understand my reply  I said it's a funny witty book about a kid that has cancer  The next day he found me curled up with my kindle sobbing uncontrollably  (well maybe that's a little dramaticbut you get the picture)  It's the kind of book that makes you feel an array of emotions and has you wondering what the characters are up to when you are away from them  I'm in my 30's and have just recently started reading YA  If this is any indication of what the genre has to offer than I've really been missing out  I just started An Abundance of Katherines and I'm adoring it so far  Read this book  You'll be happy and sad that you did
I love this book It was so sad and amazing The book is now my favorite book I suggest everyone to read it Btw this book is hilarious I hope everyone loves it as much as I did
What can I say that hasn't already been said I saw the trailer and when the book went on sale - i grabbed it And all the reviews were correct it is awesome heartbreaking but awesome
I expected more from a story with so much hype I didn't find the characters very believable I'm glad there were a few words I didn't know the meaning to So I learned a few new things
Great story Loved the raw feelings and non sugar coated details Gives you a glimpse into the complexity of dealing with tough life experiences and the emotions that can surround them
I could not stand the writing as if I was reading a high schooler's diary Loved the movie and I know Green's got a cult following but as a 24 year old too childish of a read for me
I thought it was a really good book I liked it because it had a lot of emotion It head a twist that caught me by surprise My favorite character was probably Hazel I recommend it üòÅ
Tearful entertainment Since my daughter Valentina's birth it's the first book that got me interested enough to find the time finish Make sure to have a box of tissues at hand though
As an older Army Infantry Veteran I might not be the target demographic for this book but I'm glad I read itIt's a wonderful story and is an all around inspirational read
I cried from two thirds of the way through to the end  Such a good story but if you are looking for a redemptive religious ending it doesn't have one It is so wonderfully sad though
This book was recommended to me by my daughter I loved the telling of the story the characters and the inevitable end It showed strength and passion where at times there would be none
love this book the main characters all have a heart u feel better about humanity after reading this book but does this happen in real life ten to one no but it is a must read book
I watched the movie and was truly inspired by both the main characters spirit  Having a sickness and not letting it get you down  I know that the book is twice as special as the movie
Because I have one I love I can understand Gus and Hazel's feelingI couldn't help but cryingByeGusI'll remember uAnd I will notice everything in this world
This story reads like a hymn is sung: solemn yet hopeful It explains pain with surgical description that you are left with a feeling of loss but with no scar to show Simply fantastic
A wonderfully written love story One of the best novels I've read in a long time I have to say that this is a must read for anyone who likes a good story about love life and emotion
Excellent writing compelling story I cried A LOT by the end A definite romantic must read Even though it was advertised as a young adult read I'm almost 23 and enjoyed it immensely
I knew what was coming before it came I could tell this is definitely a novel geared toward teens It didn't affect me at all really Just kept reading so I could get through the thing
This was a fantastic book It had a lot of hard to grasp concepts but was good overall I would recommend this to anyone who is looking for a little more challenging price of literature
This book taught me the most unlikely of things but the fact that true love is real shows that it can withstand anything And how true love is being a better person for the one you love
This book was so true to life   I have helped Hospice patients and their families and the feelings of the patients and their families was spot on It was also a love story   Great read
The book is just like a roller coaster with so many ups and downs that every time I put the book down I wanted to keep on reading Over all this book was amazing and deserves five stars
I first saw the movie and was encouraged by friends and family to read the book It was even better readingand again  as expected it brought me to tearsso well writtenI love love
I thoroughly enjoyed reading this book It gave great insight into how people with cancer deal with their emotions It also showed that they are able to function as normally as possible
This book is soooo stinking sad This book is soooo stinking good  I loved it but i hated how it was great at the beginning but so sad at the end i could barley read it with out crying
I read this book with high hopes of seeing the movie after A must read the movie was fabulous I would highly recommend reading the book before seeing the movie a tearjerker Amazing
I enjoyed reading the story of Hazel Grace and Augustus Though fictional it gave reason for thought of how survivors of cancer and the terminal may think and feel Thank you John Green
This was a great book Quick read and touching story line I would recommend this book for reading I was a little disappointed with how the author ended the book but still a good read
Interesting and unsentimental depiction of lives and loves of teens with cancer As a hospice nurse I appreciated the lack of cliched and cloying good little fighters language
Captivates you from the first page Thought provoking and deep but beautifully accented with flecks of endearing and fresh faced humor One of those stories you can't get off your mind
Truly enjoyed the plot So delightfully different than most of the love stories out there Characters were almost distractingly mature for their age but loved loved loved them for it
Loved everything about this book The love story the truth of how cancer strips us and so quickly  it makes us appreciate what and who we have and I loved the setting Indianapolis
This was so amazing I love(d) It was the best book I have ever read I wouldn't go see the movie until I read the whole book Guess it's time to see if the movie is as good as the book
A real novel for teens and adults alike Thank you John Green for not romanticizing Hazel and Gus's physical relationship Everything is starkly honest It is my summer recommendation
This is a wonderful heartwarming story that is well written and holds your interest all the way to the end It is a can't put it down book that touches every emotion Loved it
Thought provoking novel on how we live our lives told through the eyes of those that are dying and know it  How we approach death illuminates how we approach life  Well worth the time
A co-worker recommended I read the book before seeing the movie  I loved the book but a tad disappointed in its ending  I'm going to assume there will be a sequel judging by its ending
Touching story Deals with cancer from the patient's perspective; Their thoughts feelings and inner dialogue What's it like to live knowing your days are limited I hope I never know
I was expecting more from this book especially after seeing the movie preview When I read the last page I really couldn't believe that was it Maybe the movie preview ruined it for me
Loved this book  Highly recommend  The attitudes of the teenagers made me laugh and cry  An inspiration  Have heard good things about all of John Green's books Paper Towns is next
this book was perfectly written by a perfect author john green im 14 and my father intredouced me to kindle and i tried it and i loved it so he bought this book for me and i loved it‚ô•Ô∏è
It's a rare thing to find a story that can pull so many emotions from your soul I read this book in one sitting I just couldn't put it down This is a beautiful beautiful love story
I read this book in an hour and it was a story that touches your soul and makes you think I would suggest this book to anyone who wants to read a book that tells a wonderful love story
I could not put this book down Augustus makes you fall in love instantly and Hazel is the pessimist Such a great book about love and sickness I literally COULD NOT put the book down
I loved this book and cannot wait to see the movieI will definitely recommend this book to all my reader family and FriendsThank you for such a wonderful story
My favorite passage from this book is grief does not change you it reveals you Obviously the author has had experience with losing someone that you love I believe that this is true
amazing love story of two people that were totally opposite and end up being one  very heartbreaking at the end when the love of her life dies  this is an example of how short life is
This book will make you laugh out loud and want to cry and just feel every emotion until the last page I've never read a book like this before Definitely gave me a new outlook on life
It was a very good book I could not put it down and enjoyed every word of it It was romantic comical and sad all in the same book It was great and I would recommend to young adults
When I saw that it had been on the bestseller list for something like 83 weeks I decided I should read it Loved it and will probably look for others by this author I loved Gus &amp; Hazel
Well I laughed I cried I was happy and at times sad during the reading of this book Definitely I would recommend this novel I did not want it to end But all good things have to
Uniquely funny- my amusement felt sick at times I mean who laughs at a cancer book  Green was spectacular in capturing what it must be like to be so young with such a dire fate Wow
Although it left me really sad it was very well written Two thumbs up Way up I recommend this novel to anyone needing to be reminded of how precious and fleeting this life really is
It made me cry my eyes out until the very end And although I hate it when people die I think that Gus's death made this book help people realize that we need to live our lives today :)
I would recommend this book to everyone made me cry I would definitely reread this book over and over finished the book same day I got it anyone who reads this will enjoy this great book
I liked the characters and their challenges  In was a interesting format about young people who are facing death and how it affects their parents friends and even their support system
Loved this start to finish The writing is genius as are the characters They remind me of the characters in Juno one of my favorite movies Can't wait to read John Green's next book
The book The Fault in Our Stars is an amazing novel well worth your time I ask you to look past the summary of a simple teen cancer love story and give this book the chance it deserves
This is the first time I've read a book that I want to instantly read over again I was in love with the characters the moment I met them READ THIS BOOK but you won't come out the same
Fantastic story Very easy to read I finished it pretty quickly as I was engrossed with what was going to happen next Highly recommend Bonus is it's coming out in theatre this year :)
This novel is a heartbreaking novel that takes you through a more realistic view of living with cancer or illness It's a tear-jerker but it's absolutely worth it Thank you John Green
I want to say that first off I cried Down straight cried when Augustus died Then the ending posses me off Like no I want  to know what the Augustus's ending was for Hazel in AIA
I like how hazel says everyone has their own infinities and she falls in love with a kind of her own Definitely something to read if your looking for a good laugh and a lot of romance
I've never read a book like this beforeI downloaded it on my kindle for only $550 it was the best $550 I've ever spent  I can't wait for the movie So good I read it in 3 days :)
This was  beautiful story  I can't begin to express in words how it effected me  There is all kinds of suffering in the world but love  is what gets us through it  Thanks John Green
What a moving earth shattering ground breaking take of love living and loss I commend John Green for touching and of course breaking hearts with this novel Well done sir well done
This book was so good I read it almost straight through in one sitting It was a quick easy read but so incredibly moving It's very heartfelt and moving You'll be drawn in instantly
So good- I feel and believe the range of emotions and arc of this story Well written and heartbreaking It makes you want to grab in to your family and go on an adventure an  hug  them
This book is so amazing I laughed I cried but most of all I couldn't put it down My new favorite book I would recommend this book to anyone within the ages of 12(my age)- infinity
Liked the flow and character development Cool that it was set not only in my hometown but in my part of town I can only imagine how powerful this book would be to a teen with cancer
This book was recommended to me and it is addictive  The story is a great insight into pain and loss but with the humor and intellect it so deserves  Worth the read and the heartbreak
Still too choked up to think or write clearly; certainly not as wittily as Hazel or Augustus could have done All I know is cancer sucks life is a gift and we are all justtemporary
I can't say anything It's an emotional roller coaster that mostly goes up (you'll get it when you read the book) It's amazing It's the best book I've ever read Thank you John Green
Everything about this book I like Brings an interesting light to those suffering from this horrible disease Makes you wish you associated with its characters Easy to read Very funny
I love this book so much John Green is such an creative writer this book is a great balance of funny and sad I must warn you you are going to cry at least towards the end of the book
Omg I literally just can't eventhis book is to perfect it's so good it's not even funny I just wish Augustus didn't diehe was my favorite character Why did he have to die
Wonderfully quirky and believable characters Falling in love while being terminally ill with the big C  were handled so beautifully by the author This book will make you laugh and cry
It's a love story but it's so beautifully written in some parts that it's almost like poetry It's also very intelligent it makes you think about life in ways you might not have before
Such a  funny and fabulous book about a horrible disease  Green manages to show the reader the utterly human story behind the terminal cancer diagnoses of 2 teenagers and their friends
I was not expecting the book to be based around the life of an teenage girl but it held my intersts A heartwarming read that kept me reading I'd recommend it for anyone 14 and older
The fault in our stars is an amazing bookIt is one of my favorite books that I have readThis book made me think about how people with cancer feel and what they go through
It's a roller coaster of emotions The story is depressing but gives insight on how fragile life is and how to make the most out of what time we have and to not take people for granted
This book was exquisite My heart hurts but I feel blessed to have read this book It's hard to believe it's really fiction I could picture the characters so clearly Wow What a book
You may think this is gonna be another sad ending cancer book or whatever You're wrong This book is so honest It's not a fairy tale NO ones life is a fairy tale Just read it Okay
I cried  I cried my eyes out mostly because I wonder if I will ever experience such love  I could feel every sensation and no matter how short it was for them it was amazing 
I made the mistake of movie before book As always I found the written version a lot more gripping and allowed my mind to recreate the characters and events without a set frame of mind
I don't understand why this book is so popular Very predictable Obnoxious at times It plays into tropes too much There are sections that I liked but the book as a whole isn't great
The sarcasm and humor had me laughing out loud while reading this book The characters are well developed and gives you hope that maybe young adults still have a brain and can be witty
What an amazing book I never really thought about young people (teens) who struggle with cancer and try to have normal lives It was touching humorous and real I loved it
This was the fastest I have ever read a book It really makes you stop and think and appreciate everything life has to offer Enjoy life to the fullest no matter what the circumstances
I balled my eyes out in this book You get so connected and it is like you are with them It is an amazing piece of work that captures true love and death It was beautiful and amazing
A great story demonstrating such a deep love in a way so many should long for Did not want the book to end but loved the way the author closed the story Cannot wait to see the movie
Every girl should find their own Augustus beautifully written characters all of them The author gave cancer a face making it not only real but human Highly recommend this book
It was an amazing book I really felt the emotions and it was just the best book I have read in a very long time I would recommend this book to anyone who likes realistic love stories
It was good More than good actually it was amazing Without giving much away there's a very steep plot shift that occurs which I was not expecting I still have a lump in my throat
This book made me laugh out loud and cry real tears It's tragic and hopeful all at the same time A good read I only gave it a 4 because their was no happy ending but that is life
Well written  Interesting to see the male writer come at this from the young ladies perspective Very well done  Would've like to see the story continue  Ending felt slightly abrupt
I loved how cute this story was I wasn't expecting the ending but it was a good surprise  I'm glad I was able to read this love story because it seems more real than most that I've read
A beautifully written love story with tragic details Who couldn't love Hazel and Augustus and how they lived in spite of living with a fatal diagnosis I'm sorry the story had to end
It was so good I read it in a day If you like reading books with different genres like romance and heartache but that also produce a little comedy within you'll really enjoy TFIOS
the fault in our stars was by far the best book I have ever read it has some  tragic parts but is a heartwarming story this book was very inspirational and i definitely recommend it
A well written enjoyable book that would be a great read for anyone I didn't want to finish it because I wanted it to go on and on My first John Green book but definitely not my last
The premise of the story is touching and the characters are genuine and surprising but the story line gets dry at times and as a reader especially a young one you could lose interest
The marks humans leave are too often scars Some infinities are bigger than other infinities I'm on a roller coaster that only goes up Okay Okay
I loved this book and just fell in love with it It was so amazing that I cried tears of sadness when Gus died but the story and all the logic hidden in the book was just AMAZING
What an excellent story He had me locked from the very beginning with his note to the reader Valid point It is good to know there are still some Superb Story Tellers out there Bravo
Just dwnld also dwnld the audible feature I tried it and will enjoy listen to the book being read to me while I'm driving very affordable feature looking forward to future purchases
Beautiful story Intriguing characters Full of life humor honesty love I will think of Hazel and Augustus often I love it when an author can make me laugh in the middle of crying
Anyone who's heard anything about this book knows its just amazing The humor and truth in this is fantastic The characters are incredible I would give this book 100 stars if I could
This book was simply indescribable immaculate incomparable I recommended to anyone and everyone I have nothing bad to say I cannot wait for the movie and I hope it does it justice
I enjoyed reading this book despite the obvious ending It was both sad and charming to observe such likeable characters navigate an alien and unfair world shaped by living with cancer
This was a perfect book It is a beautifully written love story written by someone I would not have ever expected to write something so beautiful It is a five star story by John Green
I loved it I hated it though when Augustus died It was so sweet when Peter told Hazel Anna was based on his daughter to give her a second live Definitely read the book if you havent
I would (and have) recommended this book to everyone I know I gave this book a five for a reason it was heart breaking and soul wrenching yet beautiful and humorous at the same time
Fantastic book Heartbreakingly beautiful It is really well written and you will have a hard time putting it down once you start reading it I find no faults in The Fault in Our Stars
Who would have thought that a novel about two adolescents with terminal disease would be so entertaining I loved these brave witty teens determined to live their lives to the fullest
This book is both poignant and forthright in telling the story of two teens with cancer with wisdom and insight that are neither predictable or cloying  I had trouble putting it down
My daughter started reading this book and has done nothing but rave about it She is so excited to see the movie and based on what I saw I know this book is a tear jerk-er Be prepared
Excellent Enjoyed the characters Heartfelt I feel like this is one of his best works It brought insight to a subject I would usually not want to read about Very glad I did Lovely
this book kept me wanting more The end was my favorite part I wouldn't recommend this book to younger kids because of all the swearing but other than that definitely 5 stars quality
This book is very inspiring It has those good moments of sarcasm and great detail of romance and is one of the very few books that I've read that I would callA real page Turner
This book will bring out every emotion that you could ever feel Sadness happiness love hatered etc If you can handle all of these emotions in one book this is a must read for you
I loved this book so much and I was crying through most of it I love Augustus and Hazel I love them I love them I love them I love them This book is officially my favorite book ever
Great book that I would recommend for almost anyone it tells of love but still can get a few laughs out of u It shows that the world is a crappy place but with love anything can happen
My 17 year old grand daughter recommended this book Could not put it downMy grand daughter lost her mother and still hurting and it made both of think about others trying time
Very interesting book  Never spend much time thinking about the topics presented in the book  Opened my eyes to what teenagers who are terminally ill may be experiencing  Great Read
A beautiful yet tragic love story  I loved t huh e characters and the relationship between the  main characters  Wished there were more pages to read  I didn't want the story to end
Had me interested from beginning to endCried like a baby thoughHaving a disease that attacked my lungs and heart made it much more meaningfulEveryone should read
I'm a fully grown man who burst into tears on a public bus in the middle of New York City because of this phenomenal phenomenal book I read it in less than a day completely enveloped
Read this in one day Super Bowl day and I still couldn't put it down I started at about 2pm today and I finished at 10 I got addicted and now I'm sad and crying because it's over
Loved this book Young romance dealing with reality I laughed and I cried Sad when the book was finished Looking into the world of cancer survivors with a different approach to life
I was hesitant to read this because I thought it was going to be a teen book  However it was a touching sweet &amp; poignant story about young tragic love I highly recommend this book
This is beautiful written and I bawled at the end A very touching story and hits close to home since I am from Indiana I highly recommend this book to ANYONE It is for all readers
This book was truly amazing It left me in tear and I really enjoy the message it leftIf you want a true wholesome and heartfelt book then you should definitely read this one
Witty tragic and romantic I bought this one night to read in order to help me settle in to sleep Instead I got hooked and stayed up until 4am finishing the book in that same night
Liked the book sad ending but expected Nicely written I am a school counselor and will defiantly have to add this book to my collection for kids dealing with this difficult disease
Beautifully written I laughed out loud I gasped out loud and I shed many tears reading this delicious book Thank you Mr Green for sharing this masterpiece with the literary world
This book make me laugh and cry at the same time And as Hazel I couldn't stop reading an imperial affliction I can't seem to get enough of this book I fell in love of both of them
A different perspective in well written form  So many have come in contact with kids in cancer but rarely hear from them how they feel about it  Good for high school - adult readers
I highly recommend this book It was such a great story with great characters I read through it very quickly wanting to know what would happen but fearing what was going to happen too
Wonderfully sad and horribly optimistic Hazel and Gus are imperfect people who compliment one another perfectly The story would be a disaster without either of the two leadsNo words
Definitely a book for older kids due to some content It is really well written and touching but not in a sappy way I hate sappy  I would recommend it to both older teens and adults
I really enjoyed this bookI did not know what it was about but a friend recommended itI tend to enjoy YA books and would recommend this as one of my top books of the year
I couldn't put this down once I started reading  It's not a book I would normally read but based on reviews and how many people read it I decided to give it a shot It's worth it
I was personally very escited to read this book because i had read the first chapter and wanted to keep reading It came in great conditions I finished it the day it came and loved it
Loved this story It lets you think you know where it's going and then a twist Though the topic was heartbreaking I was inspired by these charecters Well written and worth the tears
I loved this book It grabbed me from the first page and never let me go The story is so gripping and relatable both heartbreaking and hopeful that I was sorry when it ended The writing is rich and well-crafted The story is not maudlin at all even though the subject matter kids with cancer seems like it might be depressing It is not a depressing book but rather a wonderful lesson in living life to the fullest grabbing opportunities whenever you can while realizing that life will never be perfect The optimism and reality is this book are mixed deftly and I never thought of the characters as victims of a disease but as normal teenagers with real lives apart from their cancer And the adult characters are also wonderful--no ogres no cliches just real people dealing with their children's illnesses and their successes I know want to read everything John Green  has ever written I can't imagine how he could have created the world in The Fault In Our Stars his vision and voice are just amazing I recommend this book whole-heartedly
Loved it  One of those books that make me cry Worth it  Puts suffering in a different light and it changed the perspective of how I view my own life  I highly recommend this book
Tear jerker  Didn't see the movie prefer books to the screen  There was an element of predictability that I don't care for in books  I prefer to be totally surprised by the climax
This is an amazing love story and quest for the meaning of life and death told through the eyes of two cancer almost survivors told with incredible insight and at times soaring poetry
loved the book has more than the movie shows and if you get confused in the movie you have more to go off of (which means you have more understanding of the movie because of the book)
Really good book Not necessarily a teen novel but good for anybody that has been with a cancer patient  Everyone knows someone with cancer We can all learn a lot by ready this book
I would recommend this to anyone but especially to family and friends of someone suffering with cancer or any other terminal disease I feel good insight into what they feel loved it
My first opinion was that the book was going to be incredibly sad  Once started I became lost in the storyline and frankness of the characters It is a must read by teens and adults
After read the book and went to watch the movie I still don't get it why so many people love this book It is a great book but #1 sales among all the books on Amazon I don't get it
this book was absolutely amazing truly lovely the romance was perfect it was hilarious and I having read a book in a long time that was so good it made me cry this is a must read
This book allowed me to not only feel so much over the characters but I was able to reminisce on similar feelings or events Lived up to my expectations Greene is an excellent writer
This book is sad Well written but fundamentally sad It ends much like her favorite novel leaving the reader wondering what happened to the remaining characters As follow up please
I enjoyed this book (written for young adults)  The story really got me into the mind of how the teenagers felt while facing their immortality  Well-written; witty and compassionate
Good book Heartbreaking Not quite as good as all the accolades though It's definitely worth the quick read it is but the ending lacks something (although that's sort of the point)
This book was amazingI read it in 4 days It flowed and kept me so interested in what would happen next I'm excited to see the movie but I'm sure the book is betterit always is
Great book As a cancer survivor the message rang true Must read especially if you have or have had cancer Humorous and witty while also maintaining the reality of terminal illness
Coming from a parent whose lost a child this was beautifully writtenSo much more then fighting cancer choosing to live and experience what life has to offer good or bad
I heard raves from young people about this book  I liked the book but reading it I wished I was that age of young love instead of reading it through the moms sad clearness of life
A love story a life story  An eye opener a reminder an emotional journey A lesson in recognizing and appreciating all that is around us Beautifully written and beautiful to read
Once I started reading this book I didn't want to stop  The book is smartly written the characters are true intelligent witty and above all caring toward the people around them
This is honestly the best book ever I'm not a big reader but couldn't put this one down Didn't want the book to end Can't wait for the movie hope it's as good as the book was
I loved this book I soo recommend it to everyoneit is based on something that can happen and I liked that you become more aware of things and more considerate after reading this:)
Do not get a second thought on getting this  I don't like romance novelsbut this book was truly amazing and if you ever get extra money or a chance and want a book then get this one
It's rare that I find a writer with such a beautiful talent for actually writing that it feels almost tangible I feel blessed to have been able to experience this book and this story
Loved it Cried my eyes out Would recommend it to anyone who loves an emotional read Trying to get my mom to read it now so we can go see the movie together when it comes out
By far the most amazing book I've ever read The writing is good and and makes you believe your always  is out there too I'm definitely going to read this  book over and over again
I guess this book was not long enough just like cancer victims lives We never have enough time no matter how long we live We are greedy for more of everything Must read not too sad
What a fabulous book I don't think I have ever read something like it  It brought me to tears many times I absolutely loved the book  If you are a book lover you need to read this
I chose 4 stars because it's a completely different topic and set of characters than id ever read and it caused me to stop and think a whole lot deeper than many other books I've read
I am including this beautifully written gem at the top of my favorites list I laughed I cried I fell in love with the characters and could not get enough Highly recommend this one
This was my first read from John Green and I really enjoyed it I did feel that the storyline and ending were predictable but I still really enjoyed the characters and Green's writing
This books is everything I had out off reading it for so long because I knew it would rip my heart out And it so did but in the best way possible One of my all time favorite books
I so wanted to love this book but couldn't I didn't think it was particularly well written and I grew tired of the main character That being said I don't regret reading it either
I read this book with a lump in my throat much of the time but I wouldn't have missed it for the world Very sweet I guess you could say bittersweet but gratifying at the same time
I didn't know what to expect from this book  I wish I had an Augustus Waters in my life  This was a beautiful tragic love story  I don't think I'll be able to sit through the movie
although this novel was geared to a younger generation I enjoyed it very much  held my interest till ending  I have recommended it too my daughter and granddaughter to read together
I had read Looking for Alaska by John Green and really liked it (I would have given that 5 stars as well) and I decided to read this book and it was phenomenal READ IT :)
This book my me cry so much and I would recommend to anyone  I love the story base and Hazel and Augustus as a couple Break out the tissues because you're going to need them  Enjoy
Wellum I just finished the book and now I don't know what to do with myself The ending was unexpected but simple and I think that is an amazing quality to have as a writer
this book is a masterpiece started crying many times and got me thinking to appreciate my life more John Green is an amazing writer thanks for writing one of my favorite books ever
I'm not really sure I read this book so much as it owned me during the course of the day that I spent with it Poignant and bittersweet I won't forget this book for a long long time
This book was simply one of the best I've ever read It is amazing and a defiance year jerker John Green is an amazing author and I really recommend reading it some time in your life
This book is an amazing story of the bittersweet sting of love and friendship while reminding us of how through laughter and living life to the fullest all ailments can be alleviated
I think this book get 5 stars all the wayThis book is my favorite book of all time it such meaning to and  inspiring and I think everyone in the world should read this book
I swear I've never read a book as quickly and thoroughly as this book And I've read plenty of page turners but this wow It's truly one of the best books I've read hands down Brava
Triggered gut responses to life  Gave me a perspective I had not considered  Perhaps the greatest impact was made when the novel An Imperial Affliction  ended mid sentence
What can I say I laughed and cried and laughed again such a raw and interesting look into young love suffering and survival the writing is witty and pure a quick and a must read
A work of literature that will literally change your life John Green has done an amazing job telling an incredible love story It is my favorite book and I recommend it to everyone
The Fault in Our Stars is a wonderful story of love and loss  It is sweet and real  I found  myself warmed by the characters honesty friendship and sense of finding meaning in life
I liked this book I loved the writing style And the characters I also loved the realness of the situation I hope to find my Augustus someday I only wish it had been longer though
I'm honestly glad that I was able to read this book  This is probably one of the best books that I have ever read  I think that everybody should read it at least once in their life 
Very well written by John Green  Truly inspiring and heartbreaking at the same time  I highly recommend this book to anyone who wants a smart funny and sad book all rolled into one
I love love love this book It made me happysadamazedexcited and in love with all the characters I think John Greens should make a sequel but make it Gus's point of view instead
One of the best books I have ever read Only negative I can think of is the embarrassment of crying on the subway while reading it  Probably not the most manly of moments
This was such a heartfelt and touching book i had no choice but to love it This was such an actually look into reality that i cried a little I definitely recommend reading this book
A splendid story that helps you appreciate love life  and death Everything else matters less in comparison Rather than to dwell and suffer you'll learn to let go and appreciate
This book really makes you remember what feeling somthing really means I have never loved and passionately despised a book so mutch For makeing me remember that pain is a real thing
I really enjoyed this book I loved hazel and Augustus character's Augustus was so like able I instantly fell in love with his character It was a beautiful story beautifully written
The writing in this book is so beautiful  I would find myself reading a line over and over again and just letting it sink inMy first John Green book but definitely not my last
A 45 really and so wonderfully told by a number of cancer ridden teens and their families Funny sadpoignant and so believable in feeling that I felt I knew hazel and Gus Loved it
I'd like to preface this in that I am beyond the young adult grouping by about 10 years  However I do work in medicine and I thought that a book about a teen with a terminal illness would be a good aid in helping me understand and empathize with some of my patients  Having that said this book did that and much much moreI've read in some of the previous comments that the teenagers are not written like teenagers but older  In John Green's defense he was writing about teenagers facing real adult issues like dying  This would emotionally age these character immensely making this book much more believable  I think he justified it well when he was quoting Otto Frank at the Anne Frank museum - how parents may be close to their children but may not really know themOverall I think that this book although fiction was an incredible depiction of a horrific situation - children with cancer  I think it did these children/teens a remarkable service by proving that they are much more than their disease
A few weeks ago my friend and her daughter were visiting  We wanted to watch a movie and as we were scrolling through the pages of options her daughter said My Girl let's watch that  I said Isn't that sad  and in unison without hesitation they both said No  An hour and ten minutes later through my snotty sobs I cursed them both  I don't do deliberately sad  I REALLY don't do deliberately sad with kids  I've never seen BambiThe only reason I read this book is because John Green wrote it and I love John Green  He did a really good thing with this book  He reminded people that sick kids are still kids  He did it with humor and with a very good understanding of kids today  It was gut-wrenchingly sad  More sad than it needed to be frankly and the kids were a tinge over-precocious even for kids who had to grow up really fast but it's still an outstanding bookI'm totally going to buy a copy of this book for my friends  In the inscrption I'm going to write It's not sad  Suckas
I've seen the movie before I read this &amp; I don't normally read like ever but this book was the BEST BOOK I've ever read and I've actually started to read more of John greens books 
But I was still crying oceans by the endI didn't hate it I didn't love itJohn Green the author mehBuy I really like the crash course stuff
I started this book subsequent to watching the movie I enjoyed the additional and/or varied scenes Any reader who enjoyed the movie will find this story of love and loss fulfilling
Loved it The movie is sooo close to the book also Although I always think that the books are best because you get more of the story that they edit out in the movies Loved to read
I love the way the story is laid out I love the characters and the real depth they possess I love their flaws and their hopes and dreams ad I love crying with their disappointments
This book is only days in the lives of sick teenagers and their families and maybe some would say they are mostly average days but that is the beauty of the story Everyday is a gift
I saw the movie and had to read the book One of the best books is read in a long time :) I was happy to tell everyone that I couldn't put it down I have to say this is a must read
I love this book The relationship between Hazel and her parents and Augustus Waters The book is sad and romantic all at the same time It shows you the importance of loving someone
This book is mediocre It is definitely written for a younger audience and is pretty genericI read it and was entertained but did not take away anything lasting from it Okay
Read with your tissues near your side  What a special book  I absolutely loved the characters and they will tug at your heart strings through the entire story  Highly recommended
I loved this book The storyline was moving and the characters even Peter Van Houten were sympathetic It was both tragic and funny I was sorry when it ended I liked it that much
Very good book for all ages- I was very sad for it to end though  I would recommend this book to anyone that might be struggling in their lives- it really puts things in perspective
It's not going to be a timeless classic but for what it is it's fantastic I would choose a John Green book over pretty much any YA author for any teenager or new reader in my life
I loved this book  I couldn't put it down  While it had its sad moments there was plenty of humor mixed inI also loved Looking for Alaska by the same author
It was good if you are looking for a sad love story  Also very good to remind us that life is not promised as well as seeing things through the view of those who know they are dying
It has been years since a book has both captivated me and torn me apart at the same time This is not a book about star crossed kids with with cancer It is a book about love and life
I loved this book Wish there was another one The movie is great too I recommend this book to anyone who wants to read a romantic love story with little humor parts in it
This was a great book  You get so involved that you feel for everything the characters are going through  I know I was constantly thinking how blessed I am to have healthy children
This book is very good I recommend it to anyone who loves sad love stories This book was written in a unique way an  I learned a lot of new vocabulary I didn't know before Enjoy :)
Can not wait to see the movie  I hope I am not disappointed  Written as if we actually sharing with her and Gus  I took time to actually get to know her  Outstanding presentation
The characters in this book are so memorable; their voices resonate with you well past the days you spent engaged with them in the book  Lots to admire in the crafting of this story
Review:  we'll written book about teenagers feelings about having cancer at such a young age  Would recommend this book in particular to teenagers going through a terminal illness
I'm not sure what all the hype is about It was okay but not as impressive as a lot of the best sellers I have read I found myself feeling like Hazel Grace did Is that all there is
This was a wonderful book well written  It took me into the story and i felt the pain sadness love and happiness along with the characters  I would definitely recommend the book
this book was just amazingly perfect¬∑ I read this book and I would suggest it to anyone because it's amazing ok I'm going to the movie theater to see this nowokay okay
I don't read novel that much however I found this book to be very fascinating Every single details were carefully written and meaningful I would recommend it to anyone in all ages
I could not put this book down I highly recommend it (with a box of tissue nearby)I am anxious to see the movie - if it is half as good as the book I will be impressed
I loved this book Good character development  Interesting plot with some unexpected surprises  The topics of cancer and death are handled sensitively  Have a box of tissues ready
An interesting take on a love story that you know isn't going to have a happily ever after ending from the start but you just can't help but read it through to the end and still smile
It's a great story that is real It is not all sugar coated but it makes you smile and cry  You let go of the petty things in your life that seemed so important and all consuming
Just this minute finished it  Great story  Reminded me some of My Sister's Keeper  I don't want to give a review that gives away the story but I would like to know how it all ends
Enjoyed the book and the writing style Interesting perspective and a small glimpse into the lives of those that have serious illnesses and different ways and attitudes to handle it
I really enjoyed this story Hazel Grace and Gus' love story was truly sweet and like no other There are certain books that have stuck with me and this will certainly be one of them
I would recommend this book to all Any age It shows how you can endure and still remain knowledgable There were some harsh truths to thIs life but overall it was an excellent book
It has been a long time since I read a book in 24 hours I can't say exactly why I loved this book other than it really speaks to human pain with a twist of humor I highly recommend
TFIOS was funny sarcastic &amp; tragic  The main teenaged character has cancer  This book made me realize infinity is what you make it  Highly recommend for parents as well as teens
A wonderful heart warming read Gave me a new perspective from the patient side of childhood/teen cancer patients I highly recommend this book I can't wait to see the movie as well
This books makes you question your life and everything you love and cherish around you The feelings invoked were loving and  heartfelt tears will brushed but it's a wonderfull book
I would definitely recommend this book to any age group or gender It is an amazing story I usually don't read books more than once This is one that I will read over and over again
The Fault In Our Stars is such a good book it has happy parts and sad parts it makes you look at life a different way I have to admit I bawled my eyes out when Augustus Waters died:(
I suggested that my 14 year old son read this book after I read so many wonderful reviews He wants to see the movieso I thought I should read the book first I am forever changed
this book had me on the edge heck it even had me crying if you havnt read this book GET ON WITH IT once you start you won't be able to stop it took me less than two days to read
Even though this is a story about the effects of cancer the author brings a wit and realness to his characters  It makes me re-think how I should respond to people with afflictions
This book was adorable not a book I would normally read but totally worth it You are engaged every minute and you think you know what's going to happen and bam plot twist Must read
Wow am starting it again incredible perception from these kids- it's almost as if some parts of this book hazel was speaking to me also recently feel  in love tis was a warming novel
This book was one that will really stick with you  I cried during some parts so just a warning - it does get emotional  But I've already recommended this book to friends - loved it
This wail pull at your heart strings  but it will be well worth it Any book that causes you to think about it in different ways long after you've turned the last page is a good one
This book is so  touching and beautiful Definitely a MUST READ It was just perfect and i can read it millions of times and not get tired of it im glad i read this book no regrets
This book was absolutely brilliant i love how realistic it is even though it is unrealistic I loved everything about it it ended perfectly Thank you  -Shelbi (age 15)
A beautifully written story of young love and the tragic loss that cancer can stealthily leach from a body My only disappointment was the delayed character development of the author
It was an easy read Less sad than I expected There were parts that were deep but not too deep I got it all I love a happy ending so this kinda made me sad But overall quite good
Good book about teenagers living with cancer Relationships are formed and lost Thoughtful book about self discovery The book did not live up to the hype I had been hearing though
Wasn't what I was expecting The story line was very bland until about half way through the book I do think it ended well and I liked some of the lines/thoughts throughout the book
John Green truly understands young people &amp; portrays them as thinking articulate intelligent human beings just going through life's struggles &amp; triumphs like the rest of the world
This is a good book but I knew the ending before it endedit is interesting though that the author is a male writing for a first person female character He did a good job though
Omg I love this book I felt like I was in the book and the last page got me I wish everyone out there is doing ok because after reading this book I think u change a lot in your heart
This is one of the best books I have ever read I could not put it down I laughed out loud and cried like a baby  I HIGHLY recommend this book I would give it 10 stars if I could
Hazel Grace Lancaster has a horrid cancer filled life and she falls in love and from that point everything seemed to go up until reality hits and Augustus Waters goes downüòäüîöüò¢
A wonderful book although very sad it still makes you feel good  John Green does a great job pulling you into this story and makes you want to keep reading it  I loved this book
What a great escape The love story is one that comfortably sweeps you off your feet and into world that warms the heartAs soon as I finished the book I started it over
Amazing story love the characters could not put it down  I can't wait to watch the movie The heartfelt story of two teens in love but with life struggles of love life and death
It's my favourite book and I just decided to buy the hardcopy today There are a lot of flaws in this book The children are much too pretentious for their age but I loved it anyway
Amazing book and very well written My only issue with the book is the end It wasn't the best ending for a book in my opinion Other than the ending the ending the book was perfect
intriguing content interesting writing and humorous writing on a delicate subject  enjoyed it  looking forward to viewing the movie rendition  hope it is not too 'hollywoodised'
5 stars greatest Book EverI rated it 5 stars because of the Beauty and bra amuse I loved itI can't think of any way else to put it I hope everyone agrees with me
to say how much this book has touched my heart John Green I applaud you and your work your fiction is more relevant than many real stories:you know how to make me notice my heart
I knew that I wanted to read this book before I saw the movie  it is more than I expected and I love it  Hazel and Augustus is a true love story for meI would read it again
Too many tissues to count The story was well thought out and detailed Th  story was honest and passionate Two young people fall in love with cancer what a twist READ THIS BOOK
What a great writer John Green is  His writing made you feel what was happening in the book  I couldn't put it down and finished it in two evenings  Can't wait to watch the movie
this book made me laugh and cry  so well written Hazel and Gus came to life as I kept reading Books like this don't often happen and I know that I will read more from John Green
This enchantingly cynical and roughly witty book engages you in a roller coaster of bipap machines and love I'd hate to give anything away but to know tragedy is to know this book
I am slightly sad that this AIA book was a made up book inside a made up book cause just like them i want to know how life ended for the characters but ohwell still an amazing read
Have a love-hate relationship with the ending Great story As a cancer survivor is really hits home especially as I watch loved ones around me pass away from this terrible disease
The story and the characters are beautifully developed Though the story is sad it gives credence to the resilience of the human spirit John green has written a truly lovely story
I loved it  It's a must read Better than the movie and you'll regret not reading it I've never wanted to cry so much and I've fallen in love multiple times with every word written
This was such a good book and an easy read  Great for young adults as well as adults  Always try to read the book before I see the movie  Next step - see the movie  Loved it
This was an amazing novel  The characters were quirky and smart and the descriptions of illness were brutally honest It made for a compelling read that was impossible to put down
WHY IS IT SO SAD WHY DOES HE DIE WHY WHY WHY WHY WHY Augustus should at least have had a reason a purpose to die And did he no it was still a good book but god seriously
This book was well written and John Green really made the reader love the characters I would recommend this book to anyone who wants to see get a glimpse of life in a different way
I read this book from start to finish in one sitting  I cannot recall the last time my heart was so connected to two characters  It will make you laugh and cry but it's worth it
I was a pleasant read even though you're in for a sad ride  I liked the parent's relationship with their sick children  The way the character Augustus was written  Very inspiring
A beautiful story with rich literary elements interwoven metaphors and memorable characters Layered enough for adults yet simple enough for the average teenager Highly recommend
This book is the most amazing book I've ever read There are some parts that make you wanna cry but it is so relatable I wish I had my own Augustus Waters Anyway I love this book&lt;3
You start off reading this book with a sense that it might lead you into a dark depressing ending Only to come to the conclusion that it's precisely opposite of that Great book
One of the most heart warming/wrenching books I have ever read Props to the author who was able to translate the language of young adults while keeping the older generation riveted
I have read this book so many times I have lost count almost the same amount of times hazel has read AIA sadly I still find myself crying uncontrollably I can't wait for the movie
Definitely produced a few tears I loved this book especially the author's ability to make such a heavy subject seem lighter through his use of spunky characters and witty dialogue
John green is a brilliant writer this book is just amazing and easily one of my favorite books ever I recommend it to anyone who loves a good love story and even people who don't
Who would have thought a book about two teenagers dying of cancer would be so life affirming so witty and so compelling Every word counts Nothing is extra A very very good read
This is one of the best books I've ever read‚ùï‚ùï‚ùï‚ùï‚Äºüòãüòãüòãüòãüòã READ IT NOW READ IT NOW READ IT NOW READ IT  NOWüòÖüòÖüòÖüòàüòçüòçüòçüòÖüòÖüòçüòåüòêüòêüòîüòìüòöüò†üòùüòöüò£üò¢üòöüòîüòöüò£üòöüòêüòÖüòäüòäüòäüòûüòäüòäüòäüòäüòä
This book was just amazing Words can not even express how much I loved every page of this book It's funny sweet and sad and I guess that's why I'm in love with this amazing BOOK
Can't wait to see the movie and make comparisons It's sad that Augustus died for It might have been sweeter if he and Hazel died together so that neither one felt the pain of loss
A sad yet funny makes-you-ponder-about-life-and-the-universe book Stupid cancer Good book Stupid cancer Great character personalities Stupid cancer Good ending Okay Always
ok best book EVER I cried so many times when I read this you absolutely HAVE TO READ  I won't give any spoilers but it just seriously gets to you like seriously IM NOT KIDDING
John Green writes in a way that pulls you in and makes you look at things different If you like love stories DEFINITELY buy this book It was a great pleasure for me to read this
My granddaughter first read this then I read it without knowing it was the book she read She is 13 All I can say is I am a better person for reading this book Highly Recommended
I LOVE THIS BOOK I was skeptical before reading it I wondered if this would just be another cancer book but it's not It's truly amazing Quite frankly it's my new favorite book
This is by far the most moving story I've ever read I feel like it changed a part of my heart It literally made me so happy throughout the book and it broke my heart in the end
I'm not much of a writer so this will be short but I really loved this book The emotions were very real the characters were quick witted and likable I couldn't recommend it more
Wow what a great book Honestly couldn't put it down from beginning to end it was such an easy read that made me laugh cry become angry and so much more Love love love this book
Thought this was a smart and lovely book  The dialogue reminded me of the Gilmour Girls  These teens were more eloquent then any I usually get to meet but it made for good reading
This book had me laughing and crying like a crazy person Incredible story- and although it's sad it's a good sad There is a lot of strong lessons and morals to be taken away here
God this is a book that will stand the test of time It's incredibly funny and witty but also sad and at times depressingI'm very excited to see how the movie pans out
Just read it Take time out of your day and read this amazing book I hate new things but I took a chance on a new book and it was one of the best books I've ever read Just read it
I've read this book three times and it completely ruined me each time It's funny witty complex and completely heart-breaking and I recommend it to everyone I know Just read it
I cannot offer you a review or I'll take away the beauty this book offers you I'm sorry that I haven't included details but I would rather have you shape this book with your heart
It was deeply moving and john green clearly has the ability to see through people's minds and understand express it The book was moving funny romantic at bits and very very deep
This book is as great as everyone says it is While I was often confused by the words I let them just roll off my tongue and kept reading because I had to I had to know everything
This book was amazing beyond belief It's tears at your heart strings and rekindles your belief in true love I would recommend this book to anyone and everyone It was a great read
Crying That was beautifully written I can't even begin to describe my love for this book in depth Amazing I think that everyone deserves a Hazel and an Augustus in their life
Very few books have actually made me cry while reading this book I thought about all of the other books I have read in this life out of all of them this one means the most
Good book well written realistic point of cancer and its victims very sad read but beautiful and realistic The ending is not written out but you pretty much know how this will end
I like that this book takes a different view on living with a terminal illness It's refreshing to see how love stories can still blossom while suffering from something so difficult
Made me smile  made me cry loved the flow of words the play with words Beautiful showing of characters and their feelings Brilliant touches- no spoilers hereRecommend 
Its WAY better than the movie  Even though I watch the movie first and get the gist of what's going to happen I still cant put it down  I modern telling of true star cross lovers
What can I say other then that I adored this novel It is perfect for a young person to read it is thought provoking and charming and I have so many great memories with this book
It is a fascinating story well written easy to understand and enjoyable to read It is amazing how the characters come to life in your mind and that's just thanks to the writer
I saw the movie before reading the book and and it seemed like a bad movie But I take The time to read and I was fascinatedThe story is surround A recommended this book
It was ok It may be better in the movie I didn't feel much connection with the characters The story is sad It seemed more like a book for a young teen audience and not an adult
This book definitely took a while for me to read It was both funny and sad at the same time I fell in love with guses character I'm glad that hazel finally told him how she felt
I really enjoyed the love story between the two left me wanting more Took me a while to finish it I felt it kind of slow Butwhen it picked up it really kept my attention
I did not think I was going to like this book But it brought me to tears John Green you are an amazing writer I never saw the movie and I am sure it will do this book no justice
If books hung on the walls of The Louvre this one would hang next to the Mona Lisa  This book features the most creatively combined sentences I've ever read it's my new favorite
This book gave me everything anyone would want out of a book it gave me a emotional connection I laughed I cried and I loved every minute of it I'd say it was money well spent
My daughter and I read this book at the same time We both read it a lot quicker than most other books we read Make sure you have some tissues near by Now we can go see the movie
A very beautiful story nicely written  In spite of the potential for the subject matter to become very depressing the author manages to keep a positive tone and and active story
Although it was fiction it seemed so real  This book had everything humor and tragedy  It was a true love story  Having recentlylost my husband to cancer I could relate
I loved readimg this It was amazing and beautiful I wish it was longer But its amazing I love the characters and plot the most Hazel Grace Lancaster and Augustus Waters &lt;3
I could not put the book down  I know it is for young readers but I am a grandmother and I loved the book  Well I hated the ending  I expected the female character to go first
As a cancer survivor myself  You deal with the thoughts of death everyday  Some days louder than others A very good book  A quick summer read  Now to watch the movie 
Great story  I had heard it was a young adult book but I wanted to read it anyway and was glad I did  I am a seniorcitizen and still enjoyed the story  Beautifully written
Better to have loved and lost than to never have loved at alla quote that I have heard and loveGreat read and sounds like a true storyand look up and feel the stars
It wasn't as good as I expected Everyone raved about the movie so I thought I would read the book instead (I didn't want to sit in the movie and bawl like I was told everyone did)
I love the beautiful &amp; glaring truth of this book I'm interested in seeing the movie but they never do it justice Thanks John Green for sharing a little bit of your soul with us
I definitely love this novel Read it three times already  Funny Touching Realistic Romantic and enlightening I started reading the book after watching the trailer for the movie
I started reading this book about 11:30 this morning It is now 6:20pm I had a few interruptions but for the most part I took no break from this book I couldn't It was amazing
A very moving and compassionate read  My 12 year old wanted to read it so I purchased to read first to see if appropriate for her  (It's not by the way) and couldn't put it down
This book was amazing it had such detail and I plan on reading it again I recommend this book to all bookworms and to everyone who isn't afraid to cry at the point of a great book
It was interesting to experience the thoughts and emotions of the characters It was a love story and a story about searching for the meaning of life and living life to the fullest
Made me really take a step back and be grateful for all the wonderful things in life no matter how small Read it within a week and I work along with having a husband and two kids
Over all easy read John Greens humor is right on the spot for me as well as the way the story progresses I highly recommend the book to all people regardless of education or age
Excellent with a turn I wasn't expecting Sad yet funny  I love how it wasn't sugar coated and fake  You experience the characters true feelings on the cards life has dealt them
Okay Okay I couldn't put the book down It's sad but a alsoFunny and  romantic It was the perfect book for me I also had a moment where I started to ball my eyes out
This was the first book to make me cry while reading it I sometimes cry in movies but rarely and never before while reading a book Wonderful book even though it was sad Loved it
This book offered many phrases and conversations that made the reader think What is life about What is or should be important in life Most of those we love are gone far too soon
This was a wonderful book I really loved it and was sad when I finished it However I am glad I wasn't reading it on the beach at the end as I became full of emotions A must read
Beautifully written and if you know or knew someone with cancer or other diseases you will somehow relate to these characters You will put yourself in their shoes Cried terribly
Th realness of the characters was well captured by John green A beautiful tragedy of young love as it is better to love and have lost then never to love at all Great for all ages
This story is absolutely truly amazingThe feels/ emotions are very strong and high in this but I can't say anymore without giving anything away Just a stunning story
I had to read the book before going to see the movienow I'm not sure I can go to the movie A very emotional look at a teenage life with cancerand love  So glad I read it
I realize it had to end like that and it was gut wrenching but the whole thing ending included was well written and witty and didn't leave the reader (me) angry and unsatisfied
While the plot characters humor and pathos make the book so engaging the philosophical depth especially the honest questioning make this book superior transcending its genre
My students suggested I read this book  I was resistant but followed their wishes  I'm so glad I did  This book is beautifully written and thought-provoking  I loved this story
This book is so sad but true I loved it and have read it many times It is wonderful and everyone should read it if they want a true romance story of two loving amazing individuals
Wonderful read It is a truest love story that I have ever read I fell in love with Hazel and Gus and not to mention their friend Isaac It is a love story with a unique adventure
I wanted there to be more but the book ended This is such a beautifully written story I want to be sure to read the underlined parts again Some are sure to be  quote keepsakes
Working with dying people you see innumerable ways of coping and not coping This book in its honesty describes how I hope I will cope: with a broken heart overflowing with love
At first I thought oh teenager book Wrong For any ages and very well written Cried like a baby We all can relate to this but this cancer book is all about love It's a must read
Read it in two nights Beautiful rhetoric alongside an amazing story I was hooked from the authors note warning of the great and terrible trap of wanting to own and possess fiction
Easy read for it is a truly beautiful story I would recommend this book to everyone First time ever reading a book by John Green and now I will be looking into his other books :)
It was a really good book I know that some people had a lot of complaints about accuracy but as far as reading for the storyit was good It's a sad story I would recommend it
I am stunned at the reality in this book about true love and loosing someone to cancerWishing there were young people who actually had deep thoughts like Hazel Grace and Gus
I loved this book Some aspects seemed a little unbelievable but they didn't take away from the over all story I cried and cried throughout Really good book Thanks John Green
Amazing read I had a hard time putting this book after I began John Green did it again I've enjoyed each of his writings but The Fault in our Stars is definitely my new favorite
Loved this book  Loved the way it was written  It was thought provoking provided opportunities for learning and to reflect on your own life all within a beautiful romance Okay
I sat down to read this book and didn't stop until I finished with tears streaming down my face It's beautiful and powerful Thanks for writing something so inspiring John Green
This book was amazing I zipped through it the two times I read it The range of emotions this book elicits from the reader is incredible It's definitely a page-turning must read
best book I've ever read So good Heart felt I dislike reading but I couldn't stop reading this one because it is so good please read it It is sooo good and sad But I love it
I will not say much Loved this book From beginning to end Cancer is tragic not funny I giggled A lot And cried even though I tried not to A drama you will not be bored with
I admittedly couldn't put this book down It was written from the eyes of a 16 year old girl afflicted with cancer I was very touched reading this and would recommend it to others
This is one of the best books I have read in a while It's so wonderfully honest And as heartwrenching as the story is it's also heartwarming and uplifting  Absolutely brilliant
This book is the best book I've ever read and I've read a lot of booksI gave this book 5 stars simply because it is an amazing bookI would recommend this to everyone
It is a quick read &amp; very entertaining  I cried in several parts  One time while in the waiting room at the orthodontist (embarrassing)  I would recommend to my family &amp; friends
Starts a little slow but Is a great story Great understanding of the age and dealing with terminal illness  Also actuallyed  meeting an idolized author that turns out to be human
Perhaps because the subject is a little close to home and very raw at the moment I found this book so engaging I couldn't put it down and looked forward to reading it every night
While not terribly deep this book offered insights into a world that I am so glad I have not experienced  I read most of this via audiblecom and enjoyed the experience
Easy readcould not put it downsympathetic characters and easily relatable  Cancer is terrible  Children should never have to suffer  All teenagers should appreciate health
I don't usually fall in love with books let alone cry while reading a book But this book brought me to tears The Fault in our Stars was an AMAZING book It truly touched my heart
I read this whole book in a matter of six hours I have NEVER cried while reading a book and I couldn't cease the waterfall flowing from my face this book is worth it okay okay
this book has never slammed me so hard in the heart i can read this over and over again their connection with each other is so unique and just indescribable its just perfect bravo
This gripping teenage romance is wrought with angst and honest thoughts  Tears poured from my maternal eyes feeling both the pain for the star crossed lovers and parental figures
This book has made me laugh and cry I feel as if it has ripped me to shreds then left me a better person for it I was there in the story every step of the way and it is beautiful
John Green did an amazon  job with this book I laughed cried I was on an emotional rollercoaster I fell in love with Augustus Waters and came to love Hazel Grace like a friend
I love this book  It is beautifully written and deeply moving  I laughed and cried and felt like I really knew the characters  Treat yourself to a great story and read this book
A beautifully written book that helped me deal with the passing of my mother in 2013 Amazing gorgeous with great flow and compelling characters I'm a John Green fan for life :)
This author truly nails the modern take on love and loss With out being preachy he allows you to see an unadulterated view of tragedy and the real meaning of life Bravo Okay
Heart warming heart wrenching and fun to read all at the same time It really made me consider my own mortality and be thankful for the good health I happen to have at the moment
From all the beautiful symbolism Greene so eloquently put in his writing to the thought provoking topics he geniusly wrote this book appeals to people of all ages and backgrounds
My daughter loved this book She couldn't put it down She was very moved and cried at the end She connected with the characters in the book and said they were very well developed
I have no words to describe how great this book was Just Wow that's all I have to say Everyone should read this book it's so wonderfully written I could barely put it down
This is one of the greatest books I have ever read It brought me to tears and I cannot say that about any other book A must read for anyone who wishes to see beauty in literature
Never have I read a book that is so touching without being cheesy and sentimental The characters are smart and flawed and real They may be dying but they live right off the page
I really only bought this book based off a recommendation of a friend I was whole-heartedly delighted after reading this book It is a truly heart warming tale of love and tragedy
It was hard for me to really decide if I loved or hated how emotional this book made me I had no trouble relating to Hazel even with her cancer she had much more to her then that
This story grabbed me from the start Tragic but woven through with a dark and poignant humor Knowing it could only end with Hazel's death it's a celebration of her love of life
I brought this for my 12 year old she loved it I can't get her to stop talking about Augustus Waters As long as she is reading she can have as many book boyfriends as she likes
I love this book The book is actually better than the movie but I love them both I can't wait to share this book with many more people I hope they like it as much as I do Okay
Extremely well written; the kind of book you have to force yourself to put down so that you can be productive or sleep You know you're going to be upset when the book is finished
This is the best book I have read in a long time Funny Honest Very real It reminds me of a person close to me that I lost to cancer and the feelings of not thoughts that I had
An easy read with a thoughtful premise  Took a while to get in touch and connected to the characters  The story line was easy to follow but some of the scenes were had to accept
I loved how deeply they loved and how okay they were with what was inevitable  We can live to be 90 and not have the depth and quality of love they experienced  I envy them both
I believe this book should be one of the books you must read for high school this book is good for all ages cause my ten year old daughter read this first and now I have read it
I saw the movie first then read the book  I am happy I did since the movie couldn't possibly tell the entire story  I loved them both This was a great way to spend my vacation
I live Thai book I hate reading but this book is the best I have ever read I highly recommend this book honestly there was not one flaw in the whole book I rate it a BMS or 5 stars
I couldn't put down my kindle A story of a whirlwind romance that lived and died at the hands of cancer Amazing book definitely worth reading again Can't wait to see the movie
A well-written  sometimes funny sometimes poignant but always brave and insightful story of two teens dealing with their own battles with cancer It has sentimental value to me
This is a very well written book I was emotionally attached to the characters and cared for them and cried just a beautiful story of falling in love and having those memories
I just went thru this with a best friend passing Super-well done I am so glad to have read this and to know others go thru the same stuff when a friend has a long-term illness
I chose this rating because the author really took metaphors and true love to a whole different level I have no complaints whatsoever I recommend this book to readers of all age
Not sure what all the rave reviews were about except for the fact that it was a sad story about two sick teenagers but I actually read it from cover to cover in just under 3 hours
This is a really great book because it tells a great and wonderful yet sad story If I were to rate this book I would give it a 10/10 because it like I said it tells a great story
Sad sweet and too often today's scenario A story about two teenagers fighting for their livesmadly in love and doing things they want and enjoying the moment to the fullest
I appreciate that it is about a battle with cancer and i not mean to be critical but it lacked emotions even for teenage love and young love that is expected to be more attached
I think the book was just absolutely excellent and it was well written and I knew that since I saw the trailer of the movie I just had to read the book first and so I loved it
The Fault in Our Stars was good but not great I read it fairly fast and the plot was interesting I found it a bit cheesy and incredible sad I cried quite a bit while reading it
My daughter has been begging me to see the movie but I warned her that I will most likely cry through the entire thing Sad subject matter very well written  Highly recommended
I am a nurse and I thought this story was really told well from the children who deal with a long term illness  I laughed and cried and felt it was thought provoking  Good read
This book is more than a sappy teenage love story it has depth and meaning It is not only about their love but their survival I strongly recommend this book It was unbelievable
While I have passed up plants of books that sit on the best seller list I was convinced that I should try this one before seeing the movie and now I'm not sure I'll see the movie
Very good just the perfect combo of lighthearted humor in the midst of serious life-changing circumstances A beautiful love story as well  A must read before you see the movie
I didn't want to read a book that if knew was about cancer  However  the writing if this book and the lessons in this book are far bigger than this dis-ease  Enjoy
A very good read touching quirky delightful and thought provokingI liked these fiesty and transparent kidsPerhaps becauseI am a widower of 8 years to cancer
How do I explain that while this book was excellent it was also a raw truth you don't want to read about will never read again But that is life and it doesn't need to make sense
Puts you inside the souls of the protagonists Dialogue--both internal and external--is superb Good pacing Believable introspection No wonder the movie follows it so faithfully
Yes the story involves cancer an  dying by  it is more philosophical than that  It is about life an  relationships and what we  do with the time we havedisease or no disease
The Fault in our Stars is a devastating but beautiful story It truly makes you appreciate love and life and how fleeting all of it can be Great read Have your tissues handy
The movie was great but the book was even better  You will need some tissues reading this one Opens your eyes about a horrible disease and how we take so many things for granted
I think this is classified asaYA novel but it is far beyond thatthe writing is incredible The story is exceptional  The ideas make you think  This is simply a classice
Very good readthought provokingfunny and sad  John Green makes the characters very real and you can feel their emotions good and bad  I would highly recommend this book
As a parent this book brought on a lot of emotions and appreciation for anyone having to deal with a child who has or had cancer It was a very fast read and I highly recommend it
This book is for sure a tear jerker but very much worth it  The story shows hope for the real meaning of love Love love love this book I recommend it to anyone over the age of 12
If you haven't read this book you are missing out Read read read this book nowyou won't be sorry you read it I'm not kidding man I've read this book 7 times it's that good
This book is magnificent sarcastic philosophical beautiful and heart breaking I would recommend it to anyone and everyone Many tears were shed and I loved every minute of it
What an amazing read I couldn't get enough of it and was sad when I realized it was done  I'm so exited for the movie and have high hopes but doubt that it's better than the book
OH MY GOD BACK UP THE FEELINGS TRUCK John Green adds a small humor small pain into my heart He just is so amazing I cried a lot near the end PG-13 book altogether Enjoy
This book had me at the beginning Warm and real story about life and death I will be recommending it to friends and family May even read it again myself Definitely a great book
Amazing Mr John Green you are a magician with words instead of cards you are the author I've always dreamed to be you inspire me and you're amazing at romances keep it up
This book has inspirational and uplifting Some words were over my head but after all I finished with many tart shed Hands down BEST book I have ever read in my whole entire life
I should have known this book would end like van Houtons How long did she live Are her parents okay Did van houton sober up &amp; finish his book How is issac Aaaauuugggghhhh
I loved this book and cannot wait to see the movie The character development was great and I HAD SUCH EMPATHY FOR THEM It was fast and a good read I highly recommend this  book
Sad but wonderful read it in 2 days I fell in love with the characters A book marketed for teens but may be kind of tough for young readers Looking forward to seeing the movie
This is a moving perspective of being young in love and knowing with certainty time is not promised to any of us The book is interesting heartwarming and extremely well written
Is it leaves me speechless I can't say anything about it really Except it is a well written book that expresses a teenagers thoughts and reactions Everyone MUST read this book
Omg I loved this book teenage love story of two cancer patients you will cry your eyes outDefinitely recommend I'm seeing the movie when it comes out in a few weeks
This book is all kinds of amazing It took me 2 days to read I have managed to cry through 8 chapters Well done John Green  -Alexandria Leigh Jenkins 15 years and 6 months old
This book really pulls you in to the cancer suffering world from a teens perspective  It does not preach too much or whine too much it is a very in your face love and death story
Awesome book It's perfect and has everything This is a must read This will leave you both in joy but sadly in tears This book though is well layed out and is perfect as a gift
A wonder and heartfelt story   I would certainly recommend this book to anyone who likes a wonderful story regarding to amazing young people who go through horrific experiences
John GreenWhat the hell I can not wait for the movie seriously touching and emotional I would have given them a bit more time together but heywho am I to say anything
It is absolutely amazing and has become my life and literally hit me harder than dobys death in harry potter or prims death in the hunger games in one book versus an entire series
The book was very realistic and showed what cancer really takes from life  Very well written  Really makes you relook at your own life and priorities  Very easy to read as well
Wonderfully written Such a bittersweet love story I couldn't put the book down once I picked it up I definitely recommend this book Just make sure you have the Kleenex nearby
This is the best book I have ever read I loved the drama and the loving story between Gus and Hazel they are the cutest couple and the sweetest couple ever Number one book üòçüëçüíñ
Read it wept finished it started over Recommended it to a friend who cried on the plane all the way back from Thailand But tears of joy too people Can't recommend it enough
This book made me cry and laugh and it is so good I know this is so typical to write but it is so true The ending was a but unexpected but amazing This bookis something else
i am absolutely in love with this book By far the best book ive ever read I cried laughed and smiled through out the whole book its worth the read I cant wait for the movie
I really enjoyed this book  The subject matter is heavy But the characters and writing are genius  I find myself thinking about the book often  after I have finished the book 
I simply couldn't put this book down It was heart retching and yet such a beautiful love story I highly recommend this book but have the tissues ready or at least a clean sleeve
This brilliant author weaves philosophy mystery love hope and tragedy into the story and spares the reader total heartbreak through Hazel's wisdom and unfailing sense of humour
You won't be able to put this book down The rich characters in this beautiful love story will keep you thinking of the beauty and meaning of life long after the last page is read
Destined to be a timeless classic  An emotional tale about star crossed lovers with wisdom beyond their years  The feels are bound to stay with you even after you finish reading
The book was unpredictable easing reading and touching  I would recommend it to teenagers suggesting the world isn't perfect but good and love and compassion make it worth while
This was by far one of the best books I have ever read I didn't see it coming and totally lost it through those last few chapters By far the best john green book I've read though
Not your typical coming of age story it's very real and sad without being too depressing or too inspirational The characters are a bit too wise for teenagers but it's refreshing
The book is incredible breath taking The way it is written is consistent modern and full of feelings I never cry reading a book and this book made me weep like a little girl
I loved this book so so so much if u love love stories I highly recommend this book It's about a girl who have cancer and going though a hard time She mets a guy and finds love
I loved it a lot it was so beautiful and showed a deeper meaning in books and the characters you look at them and you know that they can really be real people It's a great book
I chose this rating because simply it was a 5 star book It was touching but not like you're every day cancer book It was real I would recommend this book to anyone with a heart
I've never cried so much while reading a book Green really knows how to tug at your heart while making you also reevaluate yourself and the world around you Absolutely beautiful
Read this book  It will definitely make you a better person  Fantastically flawed characters a story that rips your heart out but still makes you feel hopeful such a good book
So beautifully written I expect nothing less from John green He is the type of author that draws you in and really makes you fall in love with the characters I loved this novel
Beautifully crafted with reality ready to smack you in the face on every page Ending as so appropriately needed Green has made a fiction novel feel like a nonfiction love story
I have never read a story that makes me ache so much Augustus love for Hazel is so raw and amazing I probably can't ever read this story again but it will always be in my heart
Couldn't put this book down  This book took me through so many emotions  I fell for the character right away and didn't want the story to end  Bring your tissues for this one
I didn't realise this book was 'famous' and has been made into a film having read it I realise why It was such a great read Loved the ideas and the writing Highly recommended
I just finished The Fault in Our Stars Apparently I've read it before Before the movie was a movie Which I didn't realize until I started reading it again And it was worth it
I loved this book John Green is a great author I would recommend it to anyone This is a great story and fills you with sadness joy empathy and laughter all at the same time
This wasn't nearly as good as I had hoped it would be  It just didn't sound like two normal teenagers  But then with their circumstances maybe they weren't the average teenager
Wonderful book especially with the focus on two people who are sick and develop a positive meaningful relationship in the midst of all the sadness and death of a terminal illness
A remarkable story If you have ever known a child more specifically a teen who had or has cancerthis story will make you think what it must really be like to be in their head
Amazing read The story line was great but so is John Green's writing style I love his use of vocabulary; I found myself learning as well as being entertained Highly recommend
This book truely shows what love really is loving someone for their imperfections and not giving up on them Great story Now I must see the movie and hope it doesn't disappoint
I read this book in two days That really says how well written it was I think this book will be one of my all time favorites and it's something I will read over and over again
I loved this book It brought up all this strong emotions anywhere from funny happy and sad moments It makes the heart smile and feel with the characters I recommend it 100%
This is one of the best books  I've read in a long time This book is very moving it's funny and  heartbreaking without being devastating It is so good John green is a genius
I like A Monster Calls better More believable These kids are super heros That's great but I'm looking for real unless I'm purposefully picking up a Fantasy book
The Fault in Our Stars was a great love story that didn't last long A sad story for me because cancer hit my family and my son lost his battle Now I would like to see the movie
The characters speak much more intelligently than any teenager I have ever met but that was refreshing And it was nice to re-live falling in love I enjoyed this book immensely
Wow I am speechless If I say anything read this beautiful and amazingly heartfelt work of art The beauty and truth in death and life and sickness is solo meaningfully depicted
Beautifully written insightful and thought provoking I recommend this book It reminds you of how fragile life is and how you just remind yourself to live your best life today
It was a good read It ended in a way I did not expect but I want to know what happens to Hazel Does she live for years or days Other than that I definitely recommend this book
There aren't words to describe how moving this book was for me It made me laugh cry scream It's beautifully written I can't wait to see it brought to life on the big screen
This book is amazing Cancer touches all of is in some way or another but how you deal with this touch can change your outlook on the world Well worth the time spent reading it
I gave this book 5 stars It was interesting and kept my attention Cancer is such a bad disease  It seems so cruel when the victims are so young I'm now ready to see the movie
I can't believe I liked this book as much as I did This book made me laugh cry and even get angry The story is compelling and just simply sweet I could read it all over again
This book was amazing Now that I finished its almost as if I want more words to be created on pages that just appear but the truth is that it was perfect the way it was created
Story is geared to teens rather than adults  Main character could be very disrespectful to her mother at times I'm glad I read the book but have no interest in seeing the movie
Quick read which treats love and dealing with cancer in a realistic albeit adolescent appealing fashion  Narrator's voice is reminiscent of Pony Boy in SE Hinton's The Outsiders
Very juvenile A quick read but weak story and overly dramatic writing I wanted to like it so much Who disses a story about young cancer patients But I just don't get the hype
This is one of the best books I've ever read  It's different from anything you've ever read before  Very enlightening  Much better than the movie  I would highly recommend it
It's unbelievable the acceptance these kids have to endure Excellent story easy flowing and real Well worth the time spent looking into an unknown worldGreat read
The Fault with Our Stars is a very Touching story I Couldn't put the book downits romantic funny honest and enlightening Do yourself a favor and don't miss this great read
More than inspiring This was one of the very few books I lost myself in I haven't been myself lately but with the help of realizing that more people hurt than I was refreshing
This book was not only sad but simply adorable funny  smart and beautiful and I hope that one day i will write a book just as great as this one and seriously READ THIS BOOK
Decent enough story but definitely wasn't a page turner I'm not quite sure why this is so popular I can't say I was entertained the entire time my mind drifted here and there
Perfectly WrittenA Perfect LessonA Perfect Love StoryThere is great meaning in everything around us and until I read the book I was ignorant to understand that
Best book I've read in forever  Recommend it to everyone  There were laughs and cries but in the end it is truly  a beautiful love story about two young people who fell in love
This book was an amazing book ;) I could completely relate to almost everything in the story Which made it even easier to read I would definitely recommend it to everyone &lt;3
Simply an amazing book  Just beautifully written  Characters that you just fall in love withYou will laughYou will cryYou will be touched
A story that touches you deeply  John Green tackles his touchy subject with humor and depth  It is a difficult book to put down and leaves you with love in your heart
I liked it was not my favorite book ever written but entertaining  As a cancer patient I felt I had more of a connection than a non cancer patient would have with the story line
Suffering teenagers are able to make better sense of their lives through their love for one anther  It helped me think about a lot of concepts that I usually do my best to avoid
This book brought me to tears It was well written and the vocabulary used was perfect John Green used emotions amazingly in this book I am still astonished by its impact on me
Sad but such a joy finding love when so seriously ill  Loved the characters and their interaction with each other Makes you realize the importance of living life to the fullest
This was fun to read smart without complication a tear jerker with a perfect ending Thank you John Green Thank you for this understanding of the universe and love Thank you
This  book was amazing Changed my life So many amazing quotes an I  would recommends this book to EVERYONE Did I say it was amazing yet Congratulations John Green THANK YOU
This book didn't amaze me at first But you fall in love with the characters I was sobbing like a baby during the end This book is an excellent read and everyone should read it
I could not put this book down I laughed I cried I thought about life relationships love and the small things in life that matter This book by far was the best I have read
I thought this book about Hazel's favorite book &amp; the adventure to find the epilogue to said book was amazing story telling The love story that fell in between was a sweet bonus
This book made me laugh and cry It's witty and demanding and I simply could not stop reading I would recommend it to anyone because it is a great story that everyone can feel
Beautiful and devastating utterly real in every aspect The characters age captivating and true people bringing out the realness  and the ugliness of cancer never fluffs it up
I basked for hours on endRIP my dear Augustus everyone will remember you Hazel Grace  and write a sequel old man :-) this book has scarred me forever in a good way
Even though I knew the ending ahead of time the book was still amazing So sad and tragic yet realistic I thought it would be cheesy and stupid but I was pleasantly surprised
I honestly thought this book was overrated I decided to buy it before the movie came out to see what the hubba was aboutIT WAS AMAZINGlove me some john greenDFTBA
Wow what a heart felt deep read  Excellent characterization  One of the best books I have read in years A must read for high school students and even an old timer like myself
Heard the hype and wanted to know what I was missing  This book made me laugh cry think and grow  I highly recommend this book but make sure you have a box of tissues handy
The fault in our stars is a very well written book I laughed I cried (ALOT)  and I am very proud to say that it is by far my favourite book ever and I have read ALOT of books'
I only read this book because of shailene woodly in the movie And it turned out to be my favorite book For someone who doesn't like to read not being able to put it down is big
From crying to smiling in public at my phone this is by far the best book I have ever read and I'm so excited to read Looking For Alaska (also by John Green) for my next book :)
As the book progressed the insufferable teenageriness subsided or at least became subservient to the characters' reality Needed a box of tissues for the last forty or so pages
This book is one of the few books I actually enjoyed once I started reading I couldn't stop This book was amazing and had a unexpected ending I guarantee you'll love this book
One would think that a story about cancer would be very sad but it made me laugh most of all  A very touching and romantic story unlike anything I have read  Such a great book
I may not be the fastest reader but when I got this book I couldn't put it down I got it last Wednesday and finished Saturdag the 28th Hazel and Gus are such inspirations to me
I fell in love with this book it made me laugh cry and I just love it so much I definitely give this book a 5 out of 5 if I could rate it more than 5 trust me I would :)
This is a poignant book Sadness adjacent to goodness and love Love of life and love of each other Increasing the tragedy but also reaffirming the greatness of the human spirit
The Fault Upon Our stars was everything and anything a reader could want Its heart breaking hilarious and a completly different love story you have ever read it is truly amazing
I didn't really know what the book was about but I'm in a book club and this was the book of the month so I read it I liked it a lot and can't wait to see the movie this year
This book gave me a rare insight into a journey that so many young people have to face  I thought it was a very good depiction of the emotion that these young people experienced
Truly beautiful book from beginning to end John Green for me captured true love and its meaning so well Highly recommend to both the casual reader and religious reader alike
My Kindle didn't like my finger - so no 5th star  This is probably in my top 20 books of all time (and I read a lot)  I will be reading more by John Green  Thank you Mr Green
I read this book in one sitting One page I would laugh and then I would turn it and boom I'm crying John Green did a fantastic job with it and it is now one of my favorite books
I absolutely loved this book this- it just- I can not believe that a perfect love story could end so quickly by death Everyone who is anyone has to read this book it is amazing
This book is a must read It's filled with love smart asses and tears It's a beautiful peace of literature and you could learn a thing or two from it Just read it Okay Okay
The fault in our stars is a beautiful and tragic book about 2 cancer kids trying to make the most of their short life I found the writing captivating and the story to be amazing
I was charmed By Hazel By Gus By their love and friendship Worth every miserable tear ***Note to Amazon sometimes you can say what you need to say in less than twenty words
I loved this book so much and would recommend it to everyone  I don't wanna give you to much about the book but just make sure you have tissues near by  you're gonna need them
Beautifully pieced together a story full of real emotion Take your time to admire the greatness of this book I'll say it once more it deserves to be read it NEEDS to be read
This novel is a classic The antagonist is menacing the heroes tragically star crossed and the dominant impression of wanting to leave a mark of any kind on the world we inhabit
My thoughts are stars if cannot fathom into constellations my thoughts on this book are similar to this quote because I don't know where to begin a lovely review on it
I was poised to LOVE this book but I didn't I enjoyed it but it did not blow my mind like it has to others I did really like the characters but something just felt off to me
Best quote from the book It's a metaphor see: you put the killing thing right between your teeth but don't give it the power to do its killing - Augustus Waters
This book is a really good one I couldn't help but  cry at the end as I developed some sort of connection with all the characters I will definitely re-read this book many times
It talks all the way through the book about a ending to a book that was unknownthen we get left with not knowing how her life turns outloved itcan't wait for the next one
I really enjoyed reading this book about a book It kept me going wanting to get to the end Hazel and Gus were both charming and very intelligent well beyond their age Loved it
I'm the slowest reader and I finished this in 5 hours and 40 min Over two days The writing is beautiful and challenging The story is strong and humorous yet tragic I loved it
Wonderful story told with wonderful language This book will be enjoyed by adults of any age as it has strong messages on how to deal with very unfortunate personal circumstances
I read the book because of how popular it was but I was a little disappointed after finishing it I'm not sure why people enjoyed it so much there was nothing special about it
A touching and Anti-cheesy take on a love story of two very different cancer patients on different levels of health and sickness Very touching and not your average love story
Purchased a couple of these for Christmas gifts for two early twenties young ladies They both read them shortly after receiving and commented what a great book it was
This is a well written intensely sad story I was a bit skeptical at first but once I started I couldn't put it down (nor did I want to) I would recommend it to all my friends
A great lesson written with life's irony sadness and grief  If you can get past your tears there's a love story of self of family of friendship and that one special person
I didn't just cry when I read this I sobbed And sobbed And as much as I hate to cry over fiction this book was worth it Well written easy to get into makes you think etc
The Fault in Our Stars is an amazing book it will grab your heart and pull you right in I enjoyed this book so much I really felt as if I was there with the families
Great book Really enjoyed the fun So awesome but at the same time so sad Totally able to connect with all the characters I will definitely be recommending the beautiful book
My son saidDon't read that book it'll be depressing I found it enlightening and refeshing to read about teens dealing with terminal disease from their point of view
Great story poignant and very sad Very real in terms of what it's truly like for cancer patients I can only read something like this once a year You'll need a box of tissues
I almost didn't read this book because I thought it was for young peoplenarrated by a teenage girl  Boy am I glad I did  What a profound message for all ages  A must read
Wonderful read  John Green does a great job with this book  It definitely pulls at your heart strings and gives you a glimpse into what it is like to go through it with them
The start the body even the pre-conclusion was superb But the end was incomplete No one knew what happened to Hazel Weather she died or if she continued her life with cancer
I couldn't put this down inevitably I knew what was coming but it was beautifully written and not an ending people tend to be happy with but it's an honest book just as Hazel is
Great characters The writers understands and conveys the complexities of teenagers as they navigate difficult personal struggles Wonderful storyline and worth the time to read
Haven't read a book this good in a while You feel pain and joy for every character youwish you had more time with loved characters I would recommend this book to anyone
John Green is a genius The Fault in our Stars will have you laughing crying and everything in between The feels are incredible while reading this Have your tissues handy
I love this book because it shows how not all love stories end in happy endings Also it shows bravery and makes u realize that life is a privilege so don't take advantage of it
Love this bookI cried the whole end of the book:(10/10100%Lovely sad book- so funny_yet sad yet cute I might read this  book over again &lt;3
I hope who ever read this book will all love the disappointing parts and the happy parts like when Gus died and when they sold the swing set I love this book and I hope you do to
Very true to situations and emotions Suitable for young adult readers but enjoyable for older adults as well With a story line based on cancer you have to expect some tears
It put me to tears Such an emotionally inspirational and heart rending story that gave me a powerful connection with the characters John Green is now one of my favorite authors
This book is way better than I expected it to be but a tough read emotionally  It has an honest voice and the ending is solid I'm sure it's one I will go back to at some point
This book is witty sassy and heartbreaking It makes you long for a love worth losing The plot and character development was wonderful I just could not stop turning the page
This book can touch everyone's heart an  is sad but AMAZING  Everything that happened in this book would and probably did happen in teal life I recommended this to all readers
Sad plot but engaging story  Story line was excellent in beginning but toward the middle was a little weak with lots of metaphors and unanswered questions Ending was like IA
This book is amazing I think about people with cancer differently now John Green is truly an amazing author My favorite quote was The marks humans leave are too often scars
Very good book  Sad but definitely not morbid  The characters where captivating  My niece and I are looking forward to seeing the movie  I may read other books by John Green
It is the most amazing romance I've ever read it truly touched my heart and I've learned we cannot live forever so live every day to the fullest now I see the world with new eyes
These characters are so inspiring  They had such a tough reality and they found love through it all  I feel that love made it all more bearable that they are in this together
Sure makes you appreciate life along with teaching us to accept death  This book was well written  I recommend it but don't want to see the movie  That would be a double sad
Read the book and watch the movie to get a final certain opinion on it John Green has left many of us in tears and me in a lot of anger like he had with his real life situation
THIS BOOK IS THE BEST IT IS SAD BUT MOSTLY REAL TO THE PROBLEMS IN THIS WORLD IT IS THE BEST BECAUSE IT SHOWS THAT YOU DONT ALWAYS GET WHAT YOU WANT IN THIS CRUEL WORLD OF OURS
This book touched my soulsome books you read and remember highlights or maybe nothing at all  This book however isn't like some books as it made a place in my heart
This book was amazing - nothing else to it Might want to have some tissues handy thoughPaper Towns and Looking for Alaska are also other great books by this author
I read this book knowing the movie was coming out and this book was nothing like what I expected it to be  I absolutely loved it  Very emotional and sarcastic at the same time
First book I've read by John Green Can't wait to read more and I can't wait to see the movie This book had it all I laughed I cried and most of all I didn't want it to end
I am extremely surprised I didn't cry while reading this book I got a little teary eyed but surprisingly never cried the book is amazing Read this book and read nothing else
I am in 6 grade and I read this book I loved it I started crying my eyes out Some of the words in the book were quit difuculat If you have a chance to read it I recommend it
What an amazing book Not the usual love story -- but a love story nonetheless Should become required reading in high school -- not in an English class but maybe Human Behavior
By far the best book I have read It is very sad and relatable to the hardships we all face in life May God be with all those in hard times for He can bring comfort and warmth
John Green takes you into the world of two young people sufferingfrom cancer and gives voice intelligence and many poignant momentsto their lives  A book of hope
This is easily one of the best books I have ever read It's haunting how realistic the book is I can't imagine how hard it would be to go through something as hard as hazel did
This book is amazing I never cried but that's just because I read it in class when I was supposed to be working I think hazel should have gotten pregnant instead of Gus dieing
Really wanted to read this before the movie came out  (I've made that mistake before )  At one point  I was sobbing and laughing at the same time  Great writing  Great story
This was so sad I have a new favorite book Augustus waters is perfect just saying I like how it ended with letter and there realistic point of you i really enjoyed this story
After reading this novel I feel as though I'm a better person It was heartwarming and heart wrenching at the same time I had waves upon waves of insight and emotion as I read
This book is now and foreverwill be my favorite bookit's amazing and I highly recommend that you read it I've never cried while reading a book but I cried at this one for sure
Very hard to put down once I started reading it Don't usually like teen books but has many great qualities that most teen romance books don't have Excited to see the movie now
I'm a hopeless romantic so this book was great a little sad but great I'm really happy I read this book READ OTHER BOOKS BY JOHN GREENA MUST READ
This is the best and cutest book ever EVERYONE should read it I pushed a lot of my friends to read it and they love it too Can't wait for the movie Awesome job John Green
Very well written  I gave it 4 instead of 5 because the teenagers in the book had some of the best vocabularies I've ever come across in dialogue which seemed a bit improbable
So many emotions it keeps you on a roller coasterAn easy read that will keep you wanting more and waiting for the happy ending  Very real and thoroughly emotional
EVERYONE has to read this book So sad it's over So inspirational Everything just makes you laugh and cry Hazel and Augustus break your heart but you can't put this book down
It is actually the best book I have read in a while I laughed and I cried(a lot) I highly recommend this book to young adults and anyone looking for a not so cliche love story
I kept holding back reading this but since it had 5 stars I had to see and I am glad I did  I read it in one day and it makes you appreciate your healthy kids and families more
I loved this book It was a fast read and the characters were to be commended for their courage and ability to live with this disease I couldn't put the book down  A MUST READ
Loved it Cried like a baby but loved it  It is not a classic or engaging literary work but it perfectly tells a story of a moment in time Enjoy it for what it is
I read this by recommendation and I was not disappointed Chapter 21 got he emotional but it was deep One of the best stories in my opinion I am starting paper towns next :)
This story is absolutely beautiful and it is absolutely heartbreaking I'm so glad I read this book I really don't know what else to say except be prepared to cry your eyes out
Something that allows my teenager and I to discuss cry together and share Thank you for that gift  We have even shared John Greens videos and various commentaries  He rocks
I  don't even  have the  words I'm still so caught up in the emotion this beautiful novel has  set in me that all I can do is give  it the  5 stars it deserves  Please read it
Beautifully written Appropriately irreverent Brightly witty Piercingly painful You'll laugh out loud and then cry hard And you'll do that many times This is a book to own
I love this book sooo much The emotions that John green puts  in his books are among and admiringI highly recommend this book total five stars AND I CAN'T WAIT FOR THE MOVIE
When I first started this I couldn't put it down A simply heart warming story abd worth the read I loved everything there was about this book I would recommend this to anyone
Was romantic but not like most other young adult books It actually had substance outside the relationshipSemi-spoiler****This book is depressing but worth it
Amazing writing Amazing truth It just hits you on levels you didn't know existed and now I don't know what to do with myself because it's over John Green is an amazing writer
Disclaimer: Read this novel with Kleenex on standby Bittersweet story filled with lessons on love loss &amp; laughter Should be interesting to see how the movie version compares
This book made me actually cry  It was very touching and very sad  Still it was just amazing  John Green really made this book a great read  I would definitely recommend it
Once I started this book I couldn't put it down so it was a quick read  Very good story though  The author was able to be humorous while dealing with a very serious subject
I started reading this book because my friends recommended it for me This book is life changing and amazing beyond words You will cry but it's worth it after reading this book
A lot of my friends requested this book to me a while ago and I gave in and read it  Turns out they were right to suggest it I loved the book and have re-read it many times
This book is sad It makes you cry well in my case bawl like a baby It was wonderful though I've never had a book that made me feel happy and dad and mad all at the same time
Amazing book i love this book I love his writing amazed simply amazedI can't get enough I could read it over and over again I would highly suggest it to anyone and everyone
This book made me laugh and made me cry It is very well-written It truly moves a person when they see that sometimes we don't have the time we think we have Again great book
Awesome book the author is great at painting a perfect picture about what is going on I loved reading this and I'm 26 I think it would be good for younger people to read also
Not only a wonderfully written love story but also a beautiful heart breaking tragedy (Not to mention all the vocabulary that can be learned) ( ontological Unconcionable)
I loved everything about the book: well written great characters and perfect mix of sad and sweet I would recommend this book to anyone who finds the description interesting :)
A heart-touching story of teens with a sense of humor compassion and love John Green is an excellent writer and storyteller and I recommend this book to young adults and older
This was a very sad story but also enlightening how these kids and families dealt with their terminal illnessesI liked how they received strength and supported each other
Couldn't put it downI laughed cried and did sobbed while laughing You will never forget Augustus Watersor Hazelthey will forever be in my list of favorite characters
I bought this at the recommendation of a friend who raved about it  I thought it was a well written book and good read but it didn't grab me emotionally like I thought it would
My boy said that this is the BEST book to read ever He would like to recommend to any parents who want to educate their children about fact of life and how teen talks about it
A sweet story of teen love that we've all heard before A great attempt to be profound and a sad writer who doesn't know how to talk like a smart female Still yet a good book
Thank you John Green for reminding me why I read fiction For empathy for perspective for sensitivity for love Hazels story was a beautiful part of the universe to witness
It was so hard to put it down  If it wasn't for my battery/kindle dyeing last night I would have finished it same day  Simple read but very good  You just have  to read it
I think I'm the only one I know who didn't love this book I do however like the quote some infinities are bigger then other infinities it makes total sense
WowI'm not sure the intellectual way of saying this but the book makes you grateful and sad Best of all I like that it makes me think slow down and appreciate I loved it
Heart breaking and heart warming all at the same timethe absolute purest of pure love shared between two people It is an amazing thing and can truly conquer allwell most
Great book  A true tear jerker with profound insights into the meaning of love  One ah hah moment: Hazel Grace realizes the love  she and Augustus share would not have lasted
Pretty good Predictable yes But a well written tear-jerker of a story Just enough humor to give me the occasional smile while still holding on to the real life of the story
Well-done John GreenThis small treasure of a book manages to be heart-wrenching w/o being maudlin while packing a wallop as a coming-of-age tale It's funny quirky and fresh
Quirky love story that was told with humor intelligence and heart Good reminder of how we should all appreciate every day and never let fear hold us back from living boldly
An easy read with a sad twist  Some of the content is for more mature readers  Not suitable for young middle school readers even though it's written on a younger reading level
A great book I bought the book because I wanted to watch the movie but I'm the type of person I must read the book before watching the movie based on a book I'm so glad I did
Book is great and is so wierd to read those like adult kids minds They are so realistic  and at that sickness still ready to make jokes of the diseaseI sure do reccomend it
The best part of the is the end when hazel finds out Augustus is dying and I think this because it shows truly what love is how cancer actually works Nice quotes and good book
But besides the tears there is laughter and real conversations  John Green knows how to write for teens--and he is particularly skilled at writing from the female perspective
This is a great book Don't think that a cancer story has got to be sad or depressing The book is very uplifting &amp; full of surprises I can't wait for the next John Green book
I'm so glad I read this book  It is so well written The story is a sad one but it reminds us that even though we will all die how we choose to live is so much more important
I didn't expect it to end like I did So many questions Just like Hazel had questions about her favorite books ending I think that was done by the author on purpose Loved it
Very sad but in one of those beautiful ways I'm glad I chose this book to hurt me Thank you John Hazel Augustus and every other character that made this book unforgettable
Extremely touching and fast read It was a tearjerker but also a brain jerker Pretty philosophical ideas in there that if given time can add a lot of complexity to the story
The book o far is abolutly amazing My mom and i are both currently reading it This book was reccomended to me by the televition my mother and my best friend Kinsley Nelson
It was breathtakingthe truth that just simply rose from the pages kept me hooked and made me really think about quite a lot of things we do in this life It was well written
I cried it was so amazing Augustus really loves hazel it's amazing I just wish he hadn't have died Or if hazel had been with him when he died but those are personal opinions
I read this book bc I saw the trailer for the movie I had heard of the book but just never read it This is actually the first book to ever bring me to tears I love this book üòç
I greatly enjoyed the dialog  The story had some good philosophical points to consider and ponder  I also think it was enlightening and educational in a gripping story format
I usually don't like reading a book However some reason this book made me tried and kept me reading continue because it was easy to read and wonderful love story I recommend
Loved it I read it in two days I would recommend this book to everyone Loved how the characters deal with everyday living and the courage it takes to fight for a normal life
It was good Easy to read I am not sure of the point of the novel I didn't walk away feeling any more rewarded for having read it than before But there were some good parts
This book will make you smile and cry Be prepared Read it before you see the movie I thoroughly enjoyed 95% of it The Van Houten through line was kind of weak in my opinion
From the moment I started this book I have been unable to put it down I loved the way it was written and got quite captivated my the characters I was sorry to get to the end
Excellent dialogue:  verbal repartee  Took a heart breaking tragedy and but the focus on the living as a person not a disease  Well researched and accurate portrayals as well
I've read this 14 times throughIt's beyond incredible John green has a way of looking at humanity that really makes you thinkI cried through the whole thing Beautiful
Holy carp this is probably the best book ever thank you John you made my day everyday I read it if you haven't read it please do it it will change your entire prospect on life
This was a quick read chock full of teenage angst about relationships: all the while dealing with the far more tangible issues of cancerI couldn't put it down once I started
this book was probably the best book I have ever read loved it it makes you emotional but shows you the importance of life and the people in your life definitely a must read
I loved all the quotes this book really touched my heart and I can't wait to watch the movie it's gonna be amazing I cried reading the book so I can't image watching the movie
I am balling my eyes out This is not fair to all of his readers This needs an epilogue to tell about Hazel's mom becoming a Patrick and the rest of Hazel's treatment and life
Great read and I am not a teenager I had been hearing about this book/movie so I decided to download it and read it myself  An easy amd enjoyable read and a really nice story
And boy am I glad I did  I'm equally impressed by the book AND the movie  Quick read and very relatable even for someone who hasn't directly experienced the effects of cancer
My 14 year old daughter recommended I read this book and I'm very glad she did I found the characters very like able and found it hard to put down Can't wait to see the movie
Never have I ever read a book that made me feel so ridiculous for sobbing my eyes out like this one doesBut it was a pleasure to sob my eyes out to such a marvelous book
Everything I look for in a storycharacters to care about realism and hope intelligent and clear writing humor and sadness A lovely book I hope the movie does it justice
If I could rate it higher I would I never read a book that made me fall in love with the characters and let alone feel there pain I've never cried over a book but this one I did
Illness can be a curse and a blessing This book illustrates bravery and honesty I would recommend to anyone that wants to read a good story about being honest about mortality
Couldn't put it down  I have a family of cancer survivors thank God  This story is a tribute to those who fight this terrible disease  I only hope the movie does it justice
the fault in our stars is the one of the most absolute best books I have ever read and it was a really fast read because of how great it was written with all the emotion changes
Wonderful love story of two teens trying to understand death The wise words of these two teens are beyond them and they continued to have me think about life and how I view it
A wonderfully written beautiful story that I will probably read again &amp; again Tears will be shed while reading it- but you will finish the last page with a smile on your face
It left a scar on my heart A beautiful and tragic love story that makes you appreciate every day you have on this earth A must read  Make sure you have lots of Kleenex handy
I read this book in one day I could not believe how emotional it was I cried laugh and fell in love with the character I would to see a sequel of where hazel is after everything
My sister threatened to punch me in the ovaries if I didn't read this Granted I would have cried less but somehow this lasting emotional trauma feels like a more worthy pain
The fault in our stars is quite possibly one of the best makes you cry books I have ever read But just like Hazel I wonder what became of her Maybe it is best not to go there
I laughed and cried in this book It's honestly so well written it's everything a great book should be I've never read a book that I was so happy to have read until this one
Loved every minute every word and every literary device used in this book  Anyone who wants to read a great book and needs to be uplifted or become open minded this is for you
I will truly never be the same after reading this amazing piece of writing I laughed out loud in some parts and bawled my eyes out in others Just read it that's all I can say
A touching tale of two young cancer survivors and the introspection that comes with contemplating one's mortality It's brutally honest and beautiful definitely worth reading
The best book ever it was so good and inspiring it all so inspired me to my puppy Hazel Grace Green ( She is 9weeks old:)yay for Jonh Green and his YouTube channel vlogbrothers
I absolutely loved this book It made me laugh and cry and I read it in about a day This is the book for you if you want a book on real life and maybe not a fairytale ending
This book made me mad cry scared and happy I didn't think I could feel all that in just one book Emotional roller coaster But besides all of that I really liked this book
OMG I cannot wait until the movie comes out this is by far the best book I have EVER read and I loved it so much ;'''''''''')*there were tears shed A lot of them
this book was so sad oh my god I'm so sad it it's such a epic love story but I do warn you it is a shorter read it's addicting but I wish there was a sequel but there isnt
I thought it would be like most books about diseases but this book is a true work of artI give this book five stars for an amazing plot line and unforgettable characters
I loved this book though I wish it would have gone on longer on Hazels life Now I truly understand Hazels torture of not knowing what happened to Anna's mother and her hamster
this book it really changes you it speaks to you it makes you feel differently you start caring more you start thinking more this book this book has made me its amazing
I really enjoyed the plot and the deeper meanings that the book reflected John Green does an amazing job with this book and I recommend it to anyone with a high maturity level
All the rave in the junior high/middle school set - book has tons of holds and so we ordered it on ebook for the Kindle  Middle schooler is LOVING IT  Doesn't want it to end
One if the best books I've ever read Touching with tears and laughter along the way Read in 2 days couldn't put if down Will make you rethink the way you look at everything
This book is easily one of the most beautiful stories I have ever read It kept me wanting to read more and more to find out what happens next John Green is a fantastic writer
Loved the humor in an otherwise emotional story The kind of book that keeps you thinking long after you finish the last word My first book by John Green and I'm a bug FAN now
Awesome book I usually don't like sad books however this one really makes you think This is the first book that I've read by John Green but it won't be my last Two thumbs up
Wonderful book made me hope my son and I never experience these tragedies loved the characters especially Augustus and Isaac Great book would love to read more from this author
Loved this Cried so much though Beautifully and perfectly written I fell in love with the characters This is one of those books that stays with you long after the last page
Writing does not resurrect; it buries John GreenReading must be the temporary re-animation of buried lives The story in this book is light and bounding with love
Words cannot describe this book to the full extent Not a good book for an emotional person a parent or for someone who prefers a series to a single (incredibly amazing) book
If I finished this book in 3 days it truly warmed my heart I don't know what else to say other than I truly enjoyed getting to read a beautiful love story that was so sincere
This book is probably the most amazing thing I have ever read It will make you laugh cry and everything in between If I had to describe it in one word it would be beautiful
I thoroughly enjoyed reading this book I will likely read it several more times which is not something I can say about very many books I may have found a new favorite author
How can 2 kids be so wise beyond their and accept death so beautifully I cried my eyes out yet I still felt happy for them This was such a heart wrenching yet amazing story
I highly recommend this book It was such a good read You will definitely need some Kleenex with this one I just thought John Green did such and amazing job writing this book
This is one of the best stories that I've read in a while  It's intelligent funny and poignant  It's from the point of view of a teenager but very relevant to us adults too
Warning: do not read this book in publicOne of the better young adult novels written in the last 15-20 yearsJohn Green knows how to tug on the heart strings
This is honestly the best book I've read in a long time I would recommend this to any teen/preteen in love with a good real not fake lovey dovey love story but a realistic one
The storyline is amazing and the ending is very touching I really like how the two main characters Hazel and Augustus communicate with each other Great book for young readers
I loved the book  It was amazing I couldn't put it down The ending the ending couldn't have been better  This book makes you look at life in a different way a better way
This story will have you in tears both the good kind and the bad kind I couldn't put this book down I'm sad it is over but this is one story that will stick with me forever
Although touching I found this book kinda dull and predictable  It was enjoyable but just didn't suck me in  I would recommend this book it's ok just didnt really grab me
This book was very touching and emotional I have been reading a lot lately since I am a teacher off for the summer This was one of the best of the 10 I have read this summer
I wasn't amazed by this book or anything But it was definitely a cute love story I wasn't able to put the book down and it made me cry Don't have anything to complain about
A coworker of mine said this book was just amazing and after seeing all of these great reviews I had to try  I have VERY mixed feelings about how I feel about this book  I read to be entertained - not to feel sad or like my gut is being ripped out  The writing is superb  The characters are very funny and their dialog back and forth is snappy clever - not cheesy or boring  The parents are wonderful people - I only wish I could be as good of parents as they are in such a tough situation with their daughter sickHowever it's just a ridiculously sad book  I would never pick up a story about someone's battle with cancer I lost my father and most recently my best friend to cancer and it really made me sad to read this  But I almost wish I could have past this story on to her to read - since the book tries to make comedy out of it and shows how you can live has hard as you can even as your body is dying  I know I could never read this again but I'm not mad that I did
This is the first John Green novel I have read and really had no idea what to expect considering that I knew the story dealt with cancer and I was already familiar with him from his Youtube channel The Vlog Brothers Nerdy humor about cancer Well yes there was quite a bit of that but what I was not prepared for was the level of writing and humanity in TFiOS The story was beautiful honest and every bit as joyous as it was heartbreaking The characters were vivid and clear and full of enough faults and strengths to make them enchantingly real And that nerdy cancer humor offered a candid look at the world through the eyes of someone terminally ill I've lost someone dear to me not from cancer but an equally horrific illness and I found TFiOS to capture all the love futility pain and beauty of an heroic human spirit battling it's way out of it's broken failing container This is a profound book full of humanity and depth that will be well worth rereading from time to time
Maybe it is because the book and movie were hyped so much but I found the book underwhelming It was ok but I didn't find it great and I probably won't read it a second time
This book is the best book I could have ever read it explains all the hurt in loving someone and I am happy to say that this writer actually understood how cancer children are
Amazing book it was a real eye opener that they're people in the world who really are facing these problems and literally fighting for their lives Would definitely recommend
In a way I hate this book It is so beautifully written that when it ends you are dead inside too The characters become part of you and rip your heart out I love this book
I expected that this book might be maudlin and really depressing but found it instead to be extremely well-written and actually up-lifting  I highly recommend it for any age
I chose a five star review because never in my life has a book pulled me in to the point I read it all in less than three hours I laughed I cried and I couldn't put it down
Wonderful book that explores the topic of life and death in a meaningful funny and thoughtful way I thought the characters were very realistic and the dialogue was brilliant
Book brings alive true love searing sadness and witty humor  Anyone who has held the hand of someone overwhelmed by cancer will find this book touches their heart to the core
Nothing much else to add Lots of humor mixed with real world sadness This book definitely makes me appreciate how good I have it And the people I'm lucky to have in my life
I loved how john green used such descriptive words It enhanced the story so much This book is a bit inappropriate so you should probably be in middle school once you read it
I just couldn't get into this book  That's just meI've had many others tell me how wonderful it is  I will try again at a later date but for now just not working for me
Recommended for teens and young adults who think that they are invincible; for parents who are having a difficult time with teenagers- you just need to love them while you can
Enjoyable boom to read light an easy though not the amazing story that media ect has been making it out to be But still a great story with a sad ending bit drawn out though
This was a great book I got the movie first but wanted to wait tell I read the book I cried a few times Didn't know about Gus Now I will cry again Great book  Hiedi Pfeil
Don't know which I liked the best the book or the movie which we just saw  Plan to reread the book at some future time  Good message  Gives us all something to think about
Love the names Hazel Grace and Augustus Wonderful Love story So sad it ended the way it did I wished that they both could have made it married and had children Julie G
I love it Y'all should read it if you hadn't already I think it is funny and sad at the same time I love Augustus he's so funny in my opinion I give it five freaking stars
A beautiful story of life and love and enjoying what you have in the here and now Characters that you can relate to at any age You really get caught up in their pain and joy
I found the writing style a bit stilted The story was well presented My teenaged granddaughter blubbered throughout the story Its appeal is definitely for the younger crowd
I loved John Greene's book It takes you thru the lives of a few teenagers fighting their battle against Cancer  So descriptive and emotional at times  I highly recommend it
Loved this book Sad funny touching Love the way he approached the subject You felt what they felt Seeing things thru they're eyes changes the way you look at things now
The story is  without a doubt compelling The only flaw I see in it is the voice of the two teens They seem to be the most super intelligent  humans on the planet
I read this book quickly It's such a beautiful love story that you wish you can do anything to keep going It reminds you to check your privilege and appreciate what you have
The Fault In Our Stars always kept me on the edge of my seat Their are sad points and happy points in this book which made it so interesting I would recommend it to anyone
Loved this book Very well written I would honestly recommend it to anyone who likes to read It has made me feel better about past life experiences with illnesses and cancer
There are so many books one will read in their lifetime I believe people should place this book on their list I don't even need to see the movie because the book was perfect
I was really excited to get this book I loved it It is a book that I would love to read over and over again I really recommend this book It will be worth buying
Enjoyed this book mainly due to the stimulating conversations between the main characters It handled a difficult situation and focused on their lives rather than the diseases
It took me awhile to finish this book not because it wasn't an easy read but because it just seemed to drag on It did however finish strong I think the movie will be better
I don't know my favorite part because it is all goodNobody because all of my friend that would like it already read itThis rating is good because I don't love books
I chose this rating because it was a great book there was a lot of sadness but overall a sense of enjoy life while you can  I would recommend to a teen to young adult reader
A sincere and honest story As a professional in the oncology field I recognize many young patients in Hazel A beautiful story about loving and living ti the fullest possible
This book is so different and amazing that I cannot even think about no  having read this book The love emotion and humor in this book makes it a great read for young adults
Enjoyed watching the growth of the main character  Her boyfriend was interesting too  Most of my book group felt that it was too sad but I found it uplifting and inspiring
Fabulous bookgreat for Tweens and adults tooThe author has a way with his words that allow you to be a part of Hazel Grace and Augustus Waters time amongst the stars
I enjoyed this book It was interesting and well written The characters were developed and realistic Definitely a tear jerker but I found it to be a quick and enjoyable read
This was a great book and I am so glad I am in a book club that chose this book  I recommend it to all book clubs and to all those not in a book club  Be sure to have tissue
I thought this book was sad but also had some happiness with two teenagers who are fatally ill find love However often times I found that too many parts blabber on too much
It's a quick read and a year jerker somthing that is such a touchy subject to many is made into a powerful moving novel that gives you a perspective from the patient themselves
The book had me turning pages anticipating the outcome laughing crying and then laughing again I read this book with my high school book club and we love love loved it
Well written  beautiful characters  terrific &amp; tragic love You will feel a plethora of emotions in every page A sincere and truly fabulous storyPS have tissues handy
would recommend this book to anyone and everyone of your looking for a realistic story with fictional characters such an easy read that gives you a good cry love love love it
Enjoyable to read - sad of course but a clever well-written story  Green created characters you couldn't help but love  I will have to seek out other John Green books now
Loved this book from the first word to the last I would say I wish it could have kept going but since Augustus died I wish there was more time with them together in the middle
TFIOS is brilliantly written Funny and sad at the same time John green is an amazing author I wonder if a sequel may happen Looking forward to the movieDFTBA
This book is amazing in that he is so real on his writing The only thing is there is a tiny tiny bit of foul language This is my second time reading it and its still amazing
This story of young love is very sweet  The cancer references were thought provoking  I never considered that people that fought a terminal disease might have these thoughts
Absolutely loved this book I fell in love with Hazel Grace and Augustus Couldn't put the book down and cried the whole last part John Green you have done it again Thank you
I couldn't put this book down I loved the wordplay of Augustus and Hazel  I loved their independent thinking even in love and death Their story well that's indescribable
This book was easy to read and moved along I would recommend this book to especially adolescents sick or not so they may understand what true love is It's in the heart fully
That hasn't already been said about this book It's perfectly devastating and real It makes you feel selfish but it also makes you think Could ask anything more from a story
The book was great Very fast read Having had family and friends in school with cancer it all seemed real Can't wait to see the movie to see of if the movie follows the book
I thought it was good but it got more hype then I thought it deservedNot the kind of book I normally read I don't know if I would recommend it more for teens or young adults
Great book Great love story Finally a book with a TRUE love story that doesn't sugar coat ones true feelings Shows you that all love stories don't have a happily ever after
This book was beautifully written and very believable Cancer patients are the most courageous people I hVe ever known I really felt a connection as a parent to the characters
THIS IS THE BEST BOOK EVER MADE JOHN GREEN IS AN AWESOME WRITER IF U LIKE SAD STORIES OR ROMANCE NOVELS THIS IS THE BOOK FOR U GREAT FOR TEENS AND ADULTS I &lt;3 TFIOS GET NOW
This story was written beautifully and flowed easily throughout It did not go where I assumed it would which made me both excited and then sad I recommend this story highly
One of the best written and most thought-provoking books I've ever readWould recommend a million times over especially to adults (This is NOT your average teen book)
This book was woneful And is was beautiful I think there should be a second one but all things can't come true all thought I wish they could love your books jhon green write on
It was an easy read but I felt the author tried a little too hard to be edgy It's a difficult subject and I felt I gained some perspective from the characters points of view
it's not about cancer it is about a teenagers living there lives and they just so happen to have cancer I think that this is the way to see patients as people not illnesses
Sad moving and romantic Cancer is alone is sadcancer in children even sadder I can't imagine what that is likeJohn Green has an excellent and brilliant imagination
Viewing life through a teenager eyes teenagers who want to grasp as much life as possible and yet living slowly through each moment Great phrases great thoughts great book
This is perfectJohn green is my favorite author I love him he makes life Life without  John green would be nothing compared to life with himFavorite book read it
Saw people rave about this book so ordered it It is a wonderful book that touches you Highly recommended it This story was timely to a friends child who was battling cancer
What a touching and real story  I am so delighted that my wife convinced me to read this book  The characters are deep  I would expect nothing less from a fellow Kenyon grad
Best book ever I never thought I would enjoy a  twisty emotional sad book it made me feel like I was there to witness it all it had so much depth it's my new favorite Book-
This story was well written and full of truth Anyone who has experienced cancer especially with the teenager will have a new understanding of some of their thoughts and fears
I am so beyond the valley of shattered I justwow Words fail me It was an incredible book but it left me gutted Read with caution and have a box of tissues within reach
This book was wonderful Of course the ending was very sad but the entire book overall is such a great read If you're considering reading this I highly suggest that you do
I just felt a connection so strong with this book I loved the reality and the sarcasm tat hazel grace and Gus use throughout the book The book put me in tears mannnnny times
This was such a well written enlightening story of three teens with insurmountable devastation around them  The inner strength and human spirit within them was quiet heroism
perfect book for those days that you just one to read a perfect  book:)its a fun loving heart breakibng story yet shows yoy how the real world work and ts not a fantasy:)
I haven't been this deeply moved by a novel in a long time  I felt each emotion right along with Hazel and Augustus  This book shows a new perspective for understanding life
I think the writing was very good and the characters where vivid I am still not sure whether it deserves to have 'street cred' in the world of dealing with illness Appealing
This is a wrenching funny and spirited novel featuring realistic characters I loved the complexity of the issues it presented and watching the story unfold So funny So sad
The first time in a considerable while that a book had the capacity to break my heart A bittersweet story not simply riddled with sadness and despair but also great love too
There's more than just a cancer story within these pages Very happy I gave this book a chance Beautifully written and the characters are incredibly easy to fall in love with
A wonderfully written story of love and life itself through the eyes of a young girl with numbered days It is sure to touch your heart and maybe even your soul if you let it
simply an amazing book I loved it and couldn't get enough of it I found myself laughing one minute then crying the next I can not wait to read some more of John Green books
Moving engaging and so well written  I know my teenage daughter will be just as touched as I am  Thank you John Green for giving me the privilege of reading your fine work
Soooooooooo  goood A laugh-while-you-cry type of book And definitely read it before you watch the upcoming movie I fell in love with every single character--major and minor
I'm sorry I just asdfghjkl I just can't Amazing Inspiring Emotive Thought provoking Beautifully written Wonderfully ended I cried I'm crying Just read it okthanksbye
I liked the style of this author telling about young people with cancer from their point of view  The teenage voice allowed the book to be more lighthearted on a sad subject
So well written  These characters spring to life before my eyes  I feel so intimately connected with their lives with their processes  It was a privilege to read this book
The Fault in Our Stars is an extraordinary book I have no doubt that the book would hit home with painful sincerity for any terminally ill girls but you don't have to fit these characteristics to love and cherish the story You don't have to be female have terminal cancer or be in love to relate to the characters in this novel; they were written with such personality and rich development that anyone could see themselves there in the same situation acting the same way These characters aren't just stereotypes used to represent an idea to further the plotline and the moral agenda of the author; they're real rich characters- so much so that their impending loss carries with it the same weight as if you were losing a close friend Don't think that means the book is a depressing traverse through tragedy though This is a book of hope not despair; hope even when it seems like somebody has no reason for it And for that it's as beautiful as the stars- faulty though they may be
I just finished this book after a student recommended it to me He was so enthusiastic about it I had to give it a try Since I am an English teacher and have read nothing else by the author I wasn't expecting great literature but a satisfying easy read along the lines of The Hunger Games (which I loved but it's not literary genius or anything)  I say without hesitation that this book is a masterpiece that ranks right up there with Catcher in the Rye  I was stunned at every turn in this book There were so many opportunities for this author to take clich√©d easy roads but he just never did  The voices of the characters and the supporting characters were just brilliant This book contains some of the best lines about life and death I've ever read while still maintaining the believable voice of a teenager  I cannot say enough about how stunned I am about the brilliance of this author I don't even want to read another book for a while I know it would be disappointing
I loved this read I couldn't take my eyes away from the pages to go to sleep when I should have It's very heartfelt and sent me on an emotional roller coaster (a good one)
A very Blah story I think maybe it is good for teenager readers A lot of uninteresting dialogs I only give two stars because the idea was good but the writing
A sad story but a great one too Lots of big words though I have plans to watch the movie soonI fell in love with the characters and I cried a few times while reading
A gift for my daughter She wanted this for her private library after reading it and then seeing the movie She insisted that it had this cover and not the one from the movie
This is an awesome book I purchased this for my daughter and she read it in less than 2 days She said it was one of the best books she has ever read A page turner for sure
This was a great book Even though it was fictional I thought it was inspiring The reason I didn't give it 5 stars was because it was predictable Overall it was a good book
Inspiring I say this only because Hazel Grace and Augustus waters have a way of saying some depressing stuff in a enlightened and cheerfully way Plus book in a book I like
As per the pre-teen in the family This is the best book I've ever read The characters seem so real John Green has written the best novel in the history of novels
This book was sad but not really  It was a love story about all the little things About noticing all the small acts of kindness that makes us fall in love Tastefully done
I usually rate a good book by how many tissues it takes to clean me up after the last chapter actually it took more than five I quit counting after I had to open a new box
If you measure a book by the emotions you feel this one is the roller coaster that takes you up and down But only goes up in the end Truly touching and unbelievably moving
I am on a roller coaster that only goes up my friend - Augustus Waters I love this book I am already recommending this book to all of my friends üòçLove this book
Worth the tears I would recommend to anyone looking for a good honest well-written book Perfect summer quick read Not sure if I'll see the movie I don't want to ruin it
this was a great book about young love with a twist I enjoyed reading it and was fun yet emotional I recommend this to someone who wants a fun teenage take on a hard reality
This book just warms your heart an amazing realistic fiction about a boy and girl with cancer fall in love this book is so great I'm having trouble explaining how great it is
Very well written easy to read and uplifting even though subject matter is inherently tragic It doesn't feel tragic it feels normal and teenage and I think that's the point
A glimpse into the world of cancer This is a story written for all to enjoy Especially children 10 and older those who are able to understand death and how cancer destroys
A heartbreakingly beautiful story about two teenagers who face their destinies and a certain tragic future The wit and imagery are perfect - you won't be able to put it down
Well written good grasp of voice for young adults but not for the faint of heart  I could hardly put it down but I had to take breaks from it because it was too sad for me
This book was honestly the best book that I have ever read in my lifetime I can't say why I just found a special place on my heart and will remain there for all of eternity
This book was so good I had a hard time putting the book down It was one of the best books I read this summer so far and I have read a lot People should definitely read it
I have read this book 24 times and it never ceases to amaze me He writes tragedy He writes humour There is a perfect blend By far my favorite book and my favorite author
It's my fault that I listened to the hype and purchased this book I might seem like a good read if youre15 but it wasn't so good if you are middle-aged Bad ending
I read this book cover to cover in one day It was truly a book that I could not put down once I started it Although I cried throughout the tiny book I am so glad I read it
Dealing with cancer whether you're the one who is suffering or suffering over the one that has it is rough John Green captured love heroism the human thought beautifully
Read the whole book in one sitting Certainly a page turner that forces you to think about life from a slightly different perspective Humorous and heavy Green does it right
This was a sweet take on terminal illness and young love that wasn't too sappy It hit all the traditional notes and added a little percussion A well written enjoyable read
I loved this book I cried thru most of it because I have lost so many family members to cancer the pain and love all came backI hope the movie stays true to the book
The fault in our stars in a book that finally shows what life is like The way John green wrote this book made me fall in love with all characters except maybe not Van Houten
I would not change a thing about this book Well written John Green forces you to feel a multitude of emotions so many that you don't mind the sadness so much Bitter sweet
I loved this book it is now my absolute favorite I am not an emotional person and have never cried in a book or movie but after this book that had changed I love this book
I love this book  It is a modern day Love Story  I wanted to read the book before I saw the movie  Very sad but a great story  I want to read John Green's other books now
Couldn't stop reading the book Have lost my mom sister and two special friends to cancer so could relate to what they were going through But to fall in love was beautiful
John Green is a genius and if you have never read his books before this is an amazing starting point I absolutely adore his writing and the way he makes you think about life
This story kept my attention the entire time I was reading itwhich only took me two days  John Green us a fantastic writer  Don't forget to have a box of tissues with you
Intriguing enchanting and easily addictive This was a wonderful story about two teenagers and their unexpected journey of courage and love even in the face of death Bravo
The book is short and to the point very emotional and sweet You'll end up more smiling than crying even with the difficult cancer theme Will try other books by John Green
Not much to saythis book was heartfelt deep and rivetingI'm not the reviewing type so this is pretty big for me  (Wipes tears awayspoiler alertyou're gonna cry)
I read this book on the recommendation of my fourteen year old daughter She said Mom trust me your gonna cry and laugh but you'll love every minute of it She was right
I heard about the book and thought it would be boring and that I would be able to figure out the ending easily but not true it was SUCH an amazing book I absolutely loved it
This book is the best book I have ever read It is tragic sad romantic etcI recommend this book to people who like books that change theme often or actually everyone
This book started out being one of the best books I've ever read There was a plot twist that threw me for a loop but it's definitely one of the best love stories of all time
It was the one of the best books I've ever read I highly reccomend it I also cried reading it and I'm so excited for the night before our stars and also the fault in our stars
This is a good choice of reading It is very sad in some parts but it is really beautiful I cried in some parts but it is worth it I hope you enjoy as much as I enjoyed it
This book was great that's the only thing I can think of  Hazel and Gus tell a story that most people can relate toAwesome book I would definitely recommend it to anyone
This book was nothing short of amazing It puts life into prospective It makes you think what you would do if it was you It makes you really think about what you believe in
I read this book in two days - I couldn't put it down it is that engaging Made me laugh and ugly cry too You're emotions will be all over the place but totally worth it
Loved the book Knew going in it was going to be a tear jerker The characters had great depth Read it quickly but found it hard to shake when it was over Highly recommend
I am not saying anything The only thing I must say is okay The only way you can understand this is by getting the book Okay Can't wait till the movie And once more OKAY
This book was well written and kept my attention through out I couldn't put it down and actually read the entire book in one daythat being said it was an emotional read too
I loved this book I never wanted to put it down I could retread it a million times and it would probably be better then the last time I would recommend this book to anyone
I bought this book because it was on the best seller list It's really for teens and a bit predictable Still it did pull at the heart strings so was probably worth the read
I really liked the humor in a story about dying I thought his characters were likable and you cared about them It is definitely a five hanky story but I enjoyed reading it
Just breathtaking I couldn't resist picking it up whenever I got the chance It was such a good book with an amazing yet sad ending I recommend this book it is just awesome
I believe that Hazel Grace was a very Intelligent young girl who was ready to fight her problems And I think John portrays her personality and charm in the best way possible
I would recommend this book to anyone above the age of 8 Not because of the story but because of th he grew swaying parts Besides that is the most amazing book I have read
Very timely book for my life right now as my daughter was recently diagnosed with osteosarcoma  It was heartwarming and heart-wrenching at the same time  I truly enjoyed it
I found the storyline to be beautifully tragic and romantic in spite of the youthful ages of the characters  I would most definitely recommend this book to anyone Loved it
It was pretty good just not my type of book I'm not so much into the love story all romance books I like action packed books like Divergent It's not like it's bad though
A wonderful story of heart tugging strings acutely more felt do to the engrossing quality of its writing I cannot promise that you will not cry tears of both joy and sadness
The book was amazing Haven't read a book in a few years  decided to stick to this one &amp; it had me in tears  had me smiling  &amp; had me at excited to read what happened next
A friend recommended this and I wanted to read it so I could see the movie The story was decent but the writing wasn't great Granted I'm 27 and this is a young adult novel
It is a brilliantly written book that moves the readers to tears The way John wrote it keeps it lyrical and the reader intrigued I will highly recommend this book to others
It was very good but sad and funny in a sarcastic way  Can't wait for the movie  My daughter of 13 begged me to read it so she would have someone to share her feelings with
Was very hesitant on reading this book but once I picked it up I couldn't put it down There love story is perfect and for it to come all circle made the ending even better
This book pulls at your heart strings Very good read and you really fall in love with the characters I really enjoyed the witty writing and loved crying even though it hurt
This book was something that I could read over and over againI would recommend this book to people who have emotions like strong ones because it's like a rollercoaster ride 
This book saved literature for me It's witty and fun but also achingly beautiful It's a love story that reminds us that heartbreak and love are often the same entanglement
I read this in a day which is not the norm for me but I just had to know what happened  I laughed I cried I felt like a teenager again  John Green is a very talented guy
So I normally hate reading and my friends told me to read it and I couldn't put it down and the last two pages are like the best I promise that you won't see anything coming
I don't know what to say It was and is absolutely spectacular It go especially you joy a dance of peace struggle loneliness in the word love and it brings you to tears
Witty easy to read a true page turner  Kept me up all night till l finished bawling of course  I'm a 27 year old male and this book destroyed me in the best possible way
I liked this book because it opens your viewpoint to a whole other world that one might not be familiar with It makes one see life different It's very real and quite touchy
Most people would write this review and use an abundance of exceptionally long words that push you to crack open a dictionary and perhaps your vocabulary will expand Also in the hopes that king himself (John Green) would notice it from the piles of tiresomely heavy worded reviews and spare a day to track them down so they could enjoy a cup of tea over soft music in a secluded cafe raving over the subliminal meaning that ink cannot capture I like to think that I am not among that crowd But I do want to just tell any unlikely candidates who are contemplating reading this book that it is not a collection of words selectively gathered and mass produced for the enjoyment of a million readers to appreciate then throw behind them and dismiss is yet another unfathomability that is burned into the back of our memories But it is a true infinity not captured but captivated and falsely presumed by an audience striving for critiques I've accepted this infinity I hope you can 
This is the second book I've read by John Green The first was Looking for Alaska which is one of my true favourites I've never been one to read much YA literature even when I was a young adult For some reason the books on the YA Lit shelf never rung true with me But John Green gets it He writes for people not just young adults His characters just happen to be in that age rangeThat said this book was phenomenal I read it in one sitting something I've only done twice in my life (this being the second time) I laughed I cried but mostly I just cried While this book is ridiculously sad it's also full of inspiration and hope Very bittersweet The characters were sympathetic and well-rounded and the situation was real Being someone who has taken care of a dying person I never once felt like the author was trying to gloss over certain aspects It's all hereIf you read this have a box of tissues handy The tears are completely worth it
Every book of John Green's has come out has done so at a time in my life when I needed it most It's taught me some valuable lesson that has helped me in life and this book is no different I'm not going to delve into the plot of the book you can look to someone else for that I'm just going to state the reasons why I love this book Except that words can't describe how much this book means to me I can't find the words to say how I love this book or how fun it was to stay up until 4AM reading this laughing and crying and smiling and just living through these events with the characters It takes a book that is really special for me to forget all of my troubles forget that I'm reading a book and just be there as things are happening It takes a really special book for me to forget all the suck that happened in a day and just focus on John's wonderful prose that mixes humor with sadness tragedy with reality and never once feels trite or anything but realDFTBA-Greg
This is an incredible story that made me laugh and cry  The characters are so well developed that you'll forget they're fictional  This is one of my top recommended books
Easy read damn tear jerker  Was skeptical reading it because of all the teenieboppers following it and it's popularity  Well written kept my attention finished in a day
if you want an easy read and if you want to cry this is the book for you I'm surprised I actually liked this book I hate teenage drama but how could anyone not like hazel
I just finished I can't even begin to explain the things this book made me feel Beautifully written crazy characters who are too damned insightful for their own good
This is such a good book I usually skip books that become extremely popular cause most don't live up to the hype This however was fantastic Laughed and cried throughout
I personally love this book I wish I would have read this before I saw the movie though that would have been cool I hope people will read this and love it as much as i do
This book was well written thoughtful and sincere  A love story about two teens  It's humorous and touching  Don't skip it because it involves cancer it's a lovely story
I dislike that the books ends without knowing how Hazel's story concludesI would recommend this if you're looking for a quick read with a sentimental side to it
I really enjoyed this book I like to read books before the movie comes out so when I saw this I had to read It's a very sweet and sad book but an easy and enjoyable read
I never cry reading a book but this one did it for me Really makes you reflect on everything in your life and the choices we make or could make because every day is a gift
It was a good book Well written and engaging Unfortunately as is often the case it did not live up to the massive hype Good book Yes Great book and a tearjerker Nope
Wow Wow Wow So horribly fantastic Of course I was left crying on the last damn page Such a beautifully but tragic love story So glad I read this Wow
Cute but majorly depressive cancer story meets teenagerish romantic comedy--what's not to love Honestly though I couldn't put it down--read it in one up-until-3-am session
Sometimes you read a story that grips your heart and makes you thankful for the life you have This is it  God blessall who suffer from this horrible disease called cancer
This book was magical and well written  It had an outstanding love story that will touch your heart This is a great read for young adults adults and soon to be teenagers
Excellent book many lessons here everyone should learn  A person should take these words to heart when they come into contact with cancer whether themselves or a loved one
Fantastic book  Left me not wanting to see the movie in the theater though I will wait until it is available for purchase then sit at home blubbering with a box of Kleenex
It was so amazing It didn't break your heart It made it bigger I cried twice And I can't wait to see the movie But if you boys don't like romance this is not for you
this book if taken in can change the way you look at life you need to breath it in and internalize it there are some good quotes to live by well written excellent read
I choose this book because of the movie trailer I Love this book now I can't wait to see the movie at the end it was really sad I would definitely recommend reading this
What an amazing book  I don't know how many times I cried due to the intensity of the plot  Working in the medical field this book holds true to what I have experienced
This book is purely genius with the storyline of to people having an infinite love within numbered days It is so inspiring and one of the best love story's I have ever read
Glib honest and thoughtful Teens as well as adults would appreciate the narrator's candor  This is a touching and sometimes heart-wrenching story that I couldn't put down
Omg it is amazing Everyone I know has read the book or has seen the movie and it's as good as they say it is Totally recommend it John Green you blew me out of the water
What an amazing book about friendship love and life It has completely made me rethink how i view love and life I highly recommend this book Be prepared to laugh and cry
Read it once before seeing the movie so you know the story Read it again to really hear the dialogue and now with a picture of the characters Best John Green book so far
Very touching story of love and not just romantic love but love of parents friends and sometimes the strangers we meet I would recommend it and can't wait to see the movie
AMAZING BOOK Truly captivated my attention from the very beginning all the way to the very end I had never heard of John Green before but now I'm an avid fan of his work
I loved how John developed the characters  And how the characters stayed so true to themselvesIt was a lesson in respect for someone going through tragic times
When I finished I wasn't ready The Before You Go screen jump scared me It was too amazing and I don't think there should be a sequel because it must be preserved as this
This book was recommended to me by several people as a good read  It was exactly that although very sad  I now plan to see the movie and hope that it is as good
Good book for young readers Easy read I thought it would have had more substance to it but easy enough to read in one sitting so I could see the movie with my 13 yo niece
Everyone said You've got to read it  I DID  and they were right   Many others more eloquent than myself have extolled Green 's praises All I shall do is humbly concur
I love a great book with passion and sophisticationCongrats to author and his genius mind and creativityI would definitely encourage people to try out the book
THIS BOOK ROCKED its not a typical cancer book where some one starts a campaign and beets cancer but it almost captured life at the fullest i would recommend this to EVERYONE
My daughter told me about the The Fault In Our Stars I am so glad she did I was not able to put it down until the end She forgot to warn me I would need some tissue tho
I was thrown for a loop by this book  I expected one thing and got another  Very sincere thoughts although I don't know what I would be like in the characters' situations
Such a tragic story but so beautifully written I never wanted it to end Really made me think about life illness and death in a different way I highly recommend this book
I don't read a whole ton But the dry humor irony and star crossed lovers It would be a major understatement to say it's my favorite book by far Excellent job John Green
John Green has written a story that will be long remembered by the reader It holds so many concepts and ideas of life and relationships that are sure to enrich each reader
Quick read I had no IDE what the story was about when I read it just heard someone say it was great but have tissues close by Needed tissues Great story Huge vocabulary
I don't normally read teen romance novels but I was happily surprised by the emotion of this book No matter how much we want to fight it we are all apart of this universe
I read this book within twenty four hours Picked it up on Monday late night and finished it on Tuesday  Fabulous story fabulous writing wonderfully believable characters
A very moving and sweet novel of two witty teens in love It has just enough twists to keep you hooked The only part I didn't like was the ending (as in the last few pages)
This was such a good book it is sad at times but it was very good over all an  i dont read much but all i did was keep reading because it was so good i recommend it to others
So well written that the words are like music and the characters so deep and colorful that you end the book with just a few more people you wish you could stay in touch with
No book has ever made me cry I am soaked in tears from a story that wrapped me up and shared itself with me I never put it down from start to finish Thank you John Green
Great writing for a very sad story  Very fast read that I would recommend Sort of like Tuesdays with Morrie you feel as tho you get a life lesson from reading it
A page turner Although as sad as you can imagine a book will be about terminal illness Green 's writing is clever witty and brilliant A love story so deep and beautiful
This book is amazing  It really gives you a new outlook on life  Read it alone though  People will think you are weird when you are laughing and crying at the same time :)
A simple read with so much meaning You'll laughyou'll cry and as with any good book you'll feel like you know these characters personally a part of the story if you will
An excellent story Though I had to read many parts through tear soaked eyes it was an enjoyable and addictive story Definitely will make a life lasting impression upon me
The best book I've read in a while Definitely a tear jerker Once I started reading I couldn't put the book down and now i can't wait to see the movie that is in the making
This book gripped my heart strings and sailed me through a storm of emotions Simply wonderful I highly recommend this book but make sure you have lots of tissues available
This novel is completely beautiful I cannot put into words all of the raw emotion this book brought me It puts love into a real perspective as opposed to most teen novels
Oh My Gosh This book is powerful Deep Moving Sometimes painful to read Meaningful Heartbreaking This book will definitely make a HUGE impact on you my friend Okay
I am left speechless This book can not be described in words Read the book is all I can say This book will leave you crying laughing smiling and falling in love with it
This book was amazing it was every thing that I thought it would be and more And when Augustus waters dyed I cried I hope  John green writers more good book's like this one
I've actually read this twice about a year apart and focused on different words and feelings each time Excellent and will vary based in each reader's experience with cancer
This book was so heartfelt I could imagine someone going through something exactly like this This book brought me to tears and I wish it didn't end I want a little infinity
I &lt;3 this bookIt's so sad thoughJohn Green you are a despicable human being for killing off AugustusI totally recommend this book though
this book was an amazing love storyit was not your average love story even though that's how it appears its so much more and it truly leaves a mark on your heart I love it
The Fault in Our Stars was a wonderful book It was funny yet heart-breaking at the same time I loved every single one of the characters This story was beautifully written
I'm mostly into syfy fiction But this trailers for a movie caught my eye and it looked good so I looked into the book and got hooked it to me was really good and inspiring
Great book made me cry Shows that there is such a thing as people coming into your life for a reason to teach you a lesson to teach you how to love and of course live
This Book  is not your mushy love story bull you read on the regular  It is a work of art  2 people living in the reality of their trials with cancer  A TRUE love story 
This love story brought on lots of tears It was definitely worth reading I suggest if your thinking of reading this incredible book to bring lots of tissues along with you
You will fall in love with the characters of the book especially Hazel Grace and Gus  You love Amsterdam the place where Gus and Haze Grace live a lifetime in three days
I can't really find the words to describe this book it's amazing it's well written and I don't think I will read it again At least not in the near future Grab your tissues
Wow sospectacular I could not believe this book of sadness tragic and a sad ending for Augustus I addressed this book as a young adult and processed this well¬£¬ø&gt;¬£¬Æ¬©¬¢ ¬°¬°¬°¬°¬°¬°*
I did not think I would like this book Turns out I couldn't put it down giggled got butterflies mourned cried and fell in love with Hazel and Gus I wish it didn't end
Really amazing honest book  Once I knew someone was going to die I just wanted it to slow down &amp; not endI wish Phillip Seymour Hoffman could play vanHouten
What insight into human emotions  Profoundly thought provoking  John Green 's book will bring you greater understanding of what it means to be a terminally sick adolescent
I love it so much I laughed and cried and cheered and mourned John Green has created something truly special here and a new way to tell sad stories that is honest and real
This is one of the best books I've ever read yet since about the middle I've just wanted to cryAlso why did John green have to make up AIA I want to read it
This is the best book I've read by farit's heartfelt and touching Books usually don't make me cry not a lot does but this one did I LOVE IT I recommend it to every one
This is an extraordinarily good book It grabbed me right from the beginning and I could hardly put it down The language and attitudes of the characters ring true Read it
When I told my best friend to buy and read this book I also told her to wait until the new year because the book was that much heart wrenching amazing best ever sort of book
I can't even explain how connected I am with this book At first I wasn't into it but then it sneaked up behind me and grabbed me (figuratively) and I became engrossed in it
this was a great story interesting and makes you think the characters are great and so is their story makes you wish you could help them Makes you thankful for your time
Honest writing that helps you to relate This is a romance that can be admired and a tragedy that serves as an important reminder about the trials and triumphs of life Bravo
I love this it show the truth no matter how bad it is these books are what make sense to me fictional or not I understand this Hope to read more books similar to this (:
It has a powerful message about our time on earth and the realities of cancer a living thing It's not a feel good book buts it's refreshingly honest and humorous at times
All I can say isREAD IT  I am in my 40s  a teenage girl recommended it to me  I wasn't sure what to expect but I owe her a big thank you A meaningful lovely book
Absolutely loved every page of this book It was so heart warming and brought you close to the characters I love the strength and courage of the characters My new favorite
SPOILERSThis book was amazing it made me laugh it made me cryThe novel is amazing the ending was so sad though especially when Augustus  had a pre-funeral and then when he(WARNING SPOILERS ahead) dies:( I cried at the end It was such a powerful ending though This isn't like other romance novels I read it has a lot more real emotion put into it Some people have been calling it twilight with cancer but personally I think it is nothing like Twilight Twilight is about a love triangle between Bella Jacob and Edward a paranormal romance novel about a girl who acts weak and relies on her sparkly vampire boyfriend(husband)Twilight is completely different The fault in Our stars is a lot less predictable and more short and sweet I highly reccomend this novel they already have announced that they are casting for the movie Shailene Woodley plays Hazel and Ansel Elgort will be Agustus
Read this because a friend who never reads was REREADING it I laughed I cried I cried some more I reread and reread the book I watched the movie It will never get old
Uh hello it's John Green Amazing tearful beautiful story that will break you in two and pull you back together with its beauty If you haven't read this yet WHO ARE YOU
Read this book saw the movie and then got a new kitten that I named Augustus  Loved reading on my Surface it was convenient and I finished this book in 2 days
This is a great read It's heartbreaking and beautiful and inspiring It's also quit ironic that it ended the way it did I would recommend this book to just about anyone
I watched the movie and decided to read the book  The book is so much better  The characters come to life in the book where in the movie they are superficial Made me cry
This book was lovely It's not the type of book I would normally be drawn to read but it kept my interest The ending was slightly unexpected too So that was refreshing
Wow So good such an uplifting story of brave teenagers with cancer and their caregivers loving support I vow to complain less and have a renewed appreciation for living
What an amazing story beautiful witty thought provoking and believable I cried and I laughed out loudEveryone should read it as it reminds us to live and to love
I enjoyed this book - it was heartbreaking and bittersweet  However I do wish that the scenes describing the main characters last days were less graphic  Very depressing
One of the best books I've read in along time  It's been along time since I stayed up to 3 in the morning to finish a book  It's going to be along day but it was worth it
A good book Was not overly sappy and was well written I think it may have been a bit more appealing to a younger audience but I do not regret reading this book
Great read Smart very funny perfect teen dialogue Exquisitely painful crushingly beautiful populated by heroic everymen and women Will wring you out and fill you up
Takes the delicate nature out of the way people treat disease particularly with young people Its a tragically beautiful story about people who happen to be terminally ill
Ok I accept it's a book meant for teens so some of the opinions and conversations were somewhat immature However the story was compelling and moving I really enjoyed it
Loved the whole book and its outlook on cancer and what it does to the people around you I wish there had been more of an ending but I guess that's how they also felt Lol
I cried it was so beautifully written my new favorite book The movie is great too Thanks John green for writing it I could read it 1000 Times and still cry every time;)
I would like to congratulate the author to be able to pull out this novel A simple story told well I really like how brilliantly the author has brought about some phrases
A traffic love story  A lot of lessons to ponder from the youngbut emotionally older lovers Tears were shed and I was reminded of why we love even at the risk of losing
Great Sad but happy  Hard to put it down I'm a sucker for true love which is what they were able to find at a young ageI was able to identify with those  feelings
Very sweet story about two teens who fall in love when they meet at a support group for cancer patients There was a twist that I didn't expect A very different love story
An amazing and heartfelt love story TimelessI will always cherish this journey of young love and overcoming the fear of getting hurt; the real beauty of lifelove
This was a well written book that discusses the topic of childhood cancer while keeping it in the background One of those books you don't want to put down until it is done
This book took me two days to read It is amazing What a twistI recommend it especially to people who don  take the time to stop and smell the roses Beautiful book
Thoughtful exploration of dying  It's not something that we normally spend time processing until we are faced with it Really a great story for encouraging deeper thinking
there are no words that can stress or compare to the way this book filled my heart with more concepts about life and how to view it I AM IN LOVE WITH THE FAULT IN OUR STARS
Words cannot do this book justice Therefore I will not say anything aside from stating the obvious fact that everyone on Earth needs to read this book Truly life changing
THis was a GREAT book What a great insight into the lives of our children stricken with cancer and how they cope with reality of death I LOVED IT KUDDOS to John Green
This book is truly brilliant I would highly recommend it to any book lover Spoiler alert: This book will make you cry I cried myself three or four times near the ending
A wonderful love story  Teenagers dealing with huge life changing issues  Wonderfully written By the end of the book I felt a connection to the characters  A must read
The Fault in our stars was an amazing book and really describes the reality of life It is the best book I've ever read I hope others learn from this book just as I did :)
Nicholas sparks meets intelligent teenage reality This book brought me to tears but John Greene incorporates witty humor throughout I could easily read this over and over
My daughter who is 20 recommended this movie but suggested reading the book first  An excellent storyline  Can't wait to see the movie  Hope it is as good as the book
A quick read A meaningful story Touches your heart What love is all about living amongst the stars  The true meaning of mothers love What you wouldn't do for your child
There is not much to say My heart has been broken in such a way that's so wonderfullbeautifully writtenlovesacrificedeath and truthI couldn't have asked for more
Best book everThis book was honestly the best one I've ever read Now I'm not a reader but I can honestly say this is my favorite book  I wish it would last forever
This book is one of those book that makes you laugh one second and cry the other  But thanks to John Green 's brilliance The Fault In Our Stars was truly a masterpiece
this book was amazing I never cry while reading a book but while reading this book I cried a few times and I'm at a loss for words I'm definitely going to read this again
I have read this book TWICE now I'm so obsessed with it After losing one of my best friends to brain cancer I feel like this book is so close to true it's def a MUST read
loved the book - well written - great plot twist - and Indianapolis references  The characters were believable and made you care about them - both the teens and the adults
My favorite thing about this book really is the biting brutal gallows humor People in the trenches team done jokes v that will burn your way hairs out that's for datn sure
I loved the book  It was heartwarming and made me laugh a lot and I truly enjoyed the characters  It also made me ugly cry but that was part of the beauty of this book
I just adore this incredibly poetic love story it's so passionate and shows that no matter how young you are or how bad your situation may be you are capable of true love
I am INSPIRED to leave a mark on the world may it be large or small I think John Green captured the essence and hardships of reality with the sweet happiness of affection
But it's really not - even though it has it's moments the subject matter doesn't drag the book through the depths of despair like you might imagine I enjoyed it very much
What a wonderful book  It captured the not only the main characters but also the parent's protective as well I would recommend to readers young and old and all in between
Dealing with life and deciding what is real and what is worth knowing to a teenager who knows adulthood is possibly impossible is something this book gives real meaning to
An astonishingly well written account of love and loss John Green perfectly captures the wide range of emotions of a young cancer patient in this beautifully crafted novel
I read many glowing reviews on this book so I am disappointed to say that I didn't love it I did not like the language particularly and I was disappointed by the content
I thoroughly enjoy books that specialize in character development I felt like they were real I miss them already Thank you for a good read while enjoying my Spring break
I really enjoyed this book  I loved the relationships the main characters had with each other and their families  It is very honest sometimes very sad but very fulfilling
This book is amazing I was so moved by it The book is a sad love story between Augustus and Hazel the two main characters who both have Cancer You should read this book
It was not what I had expected it to be I thought it was going to be a typical story of a person dying of cancer It most definitely was notI thoroughly enjoyed this book
A must read with tissues  The honesty of teenagers coupled with facing death would be a difficult story to tell for anyone John Green does it well Prepare to cry a river
Great book I was hooked on the third paragraph I could not put it down afterwards The characters are very likable and easy to relate too Best book I have read in a while
This book is a real eye opener It makes you really think about the world and your life I would recommend this book to all young adult and teen readers Absolutely amazing
A reader  can only hope to live and love so fully and passionately  Certainly thought provoking on countless levels  Impressive a book can leave you with so many emotions
Very sweet book would definitely recommend it Could not put down the book until the very end It had me squeeling laughing sighing and in the end in tears A must read
The only reason I didn't give this a 5 is because it is fairly predictable  However if you take the time to think deeper about Green's messages it turns into a great read
Easy to love characters interlaced with a captivating story A quick read that engulfs you as turn the pages pulling you deeper and deeper into the lives of the characters
This book is all about the truth and what you get from the truth It is true down to each and every syllable I strongly recommend it for every one striving to leave a mark
Brilliant I rarely ever write reviews However I had to make an exception for this book I could not put it down I laughed I cried and I became a character in the story
this book is amazing and heartwarming it really shows the importance of friends family and life i cried at the end i definately recommend this book for ages 13 and up
A bittersweet story about love life and death One of the best books I have read Augustus and Hazel will steal your heart and leave you thinking of them for daysmonths
This book brought me to tears In the three weeks that I have owned it on my Kindle I have read it at least five times It exceeds the hype Everyone should read this book
Teenage 'love' between 2 dying cancer victims the plot was too predictable the characters not quite believable But I did finish the book mostly when I get bored I don't
This book was a great fast-paced read I would definitely read again and I look forward to reading more of John Green 's books Relatable characters and a believable story
Loved it  made me cry
YA books are often so self-serious particularly ones about dark subject matter But this book was hilarious and so wholly original written in a voice I'd never before encountered in YA literature Like it was really HILARIOUS Even after tragic scenes I found myself laughing out loud in a moment's time But it didn't distract from the story -- it enhanced it The humor helped to make the disturbing subject matter that much more poignantThe characters were flawless -- realistic relatable inspiring so very teenaged and yet wise beyond their years I'm amazed by Green's intriguing and thought-provoking themes macro and micro -- masterfully woven both across the entire book and within little scenelitsThere was no wasted space no wasted sentence just writing jam-packed with brilliance Read this book TodayAs for my rating The fault dear Brutus is in the Amazon stars; if I could I would award fifty instead of five
I cried and cried Such a sweet and tragic love  I have to say I loved the book so much more than the move that came out The movie was lacking a lot of what the book had
This is a book that could (&amp; should) change the way people view life love happiness and pain It should make you step back and realize how truly precious life really is
I like this book - a lot I would definitely recommend to others The funeral scene took me back to when I lost my grandma (not from cancer but I was really close to her)
I am a 24 year old dude and after reading the synopsis I never thought I would enjoy this book much however it was surprisingly delightfulDefinitely worth a a read
Beautifully written and full of charm  Sad but not in a way that leaves you feeling awful just humble and thoughtful Well worth the few short hours it takes to read it
Even though I read this after the movie came out I was not prepared for the ending The author does a good job of exploring young love especially young love under duress
Great love story; mesmerizing  You will not forget Augustus Waters and Hazel Grace  Their's is a love story that reminds us that true love exists and embraces the senses
I would recommend this book to any teen out there looking for a romance novel that isn't cheesy it was so good and straight to the point with everything such a good book
A  thought-provoking and emotional read that uplifts  Very interesting protaganists who were believable and likeable  The story line sounds like a bummer but truly isn't
I laughed I cried and cried it's a book about teenagers with cancer but the author kept it light I would include this book in my top 100 must-read before you die books
Beautifully written bookit was startlingly original and painfully accurate I loved every word that John Green has penned here and cannot wait to read more of his books
I thought the teenagers felt a bit pretentious As an adult who reads a lot of YA there are lots of other authors that do a much better job of capturing the teenage psyche
If you have ever been lucky enough to be touched with the life of someone who is inflicted with cancer this book will eat at you in a sad but satisfying and gratifying way
Although compelling and without a doubt draws the reader in emotionally there is something about the characters that is lacking  The storyline is also quite predictable
I am probably going to re-read this book soon The writing was honest and beautiful The story was one that I'm sure many people can relate to A thoroughly enjoyable read
It was a good book even though I was pretty sure due to the subject matter it wouldn't end wellThe plot was well developed and the characters were all very lovable
This book was amazing I finished it in three days and never wanted to put it down this is a must read book and I will definitely be rereading this book over and over again
Loved it Poignant funny and beautiful with many astute observations on the meaning (or lack thereof) of life as seen through the eyes of sarcastic and witty teenagers
Not often you can read a book that can touch you like this book doesI haven't seen the movie I prefer to read the book firstRecommend reading for everyone
Gives an important understanding in living life well A beautiful story about touching others  Couldn't put it down The author made the characters in the story seem real
What a wonderful account of the process of disease I have watched it in my wife but never a child Should be manditory reading for all who professionally deal with grief
loved this book it's so moving and sweet and I love all the characters: Hazel(of course)also Isaac Gus even Van Houten this is definitely one if my favorite books
I just got done reading the ending The Fault In Our Stars is officially my favorite book of all time It's so unpredictable and suspenseful Always keeping me on my toes
I couldn't put this beautiful and eloquently written book down It's interesting to have an honest perspective from a cancer patient where nothing seems to be sugar coated
You just can't stop turning the pages I'm not quite a reader but it's my first time to finish a book this fast And this is the first book I've finished reading this year
I can't even describe how wonderful this book is It made me laugh and cry in the same breath Definitely keep a box of tissues near you when reading this book I loved it
I chose this rating because this book was amazing I'm so glad I read it It's a sad and romantic story I cried This was amazing Thank you John Green for an amazing book
I highly recommend this book to anyone who loves to read This book is very hard to put down because it is so great I really enjoyed it and I cannot wait to see the movie
Wonderful and vary sweet story I could not put it down Very well written  Liked the vocabuly of each of the stars Saw the movie after reading the book Loved the story
This is by far the greatest most saddest novel I've ever read I can not wait to see the movie I also can not wait to read more by the same author Triple thumbs up üëçüëçüëç
I love this book I have read it multiple times I like how it is very raw land you get to fall I'm love with the sick love story of hazel grace Lancaster and agustus waters
I couldn't put this book down It definitely draws you into reading it But when I was finished I felt like I just wanted more I feel like it could of had more at the end
Green had written a beautiful novel I just finish and am considering rereading it right away My we all find true love like Augustus and Hazel no matter what how painful 
The Fault in Our Stars is a fantastic book about star cross lovers who love each other then are separated you will love this book through the tears and through the laughs
I loved this book as it makes one realise that cancer sufferers are just normal human beings I laughed out loud cried a few silent tears and really enjoyed a goid read
this book is a romantic love story that once you read it you can't get it out of your mind it is amazing &amp;&amp; couldn't live life without a love story as amazing as this one
I disliked that at the funeral hazel didn't talk to Isaac But I loved the part where Augustus isn't afraid to let the world know he is deeply and madly in live with hazel
I loved everything about this book  It is the best book I have read in a long time  Cried a lot keep plenty of tissues close  I can't wait to see the movie  EXCELLENT
Really thoughtfully book My first John Greene read and I certainly have no regrets at all That Augustus is sure one romantic fellow and we all need a Hazel in our lives
I picked up this book and couldn't put it down It is a great love story that in my opinion surpasses Romeo and Juliet However I will admit that it is on the girly side
Book had me in tears I got hooked right away Read the whole thing in just one day It had a dramatic turn that I did not expect and kept me awake until 1:35 to finish it
I read it before it became popular and it automatically made my top 5 favorite book list I've re-read it multiple times and fall in love with the story all over again :)
I am not a fan of sad books personally but I could not put this book down I reccomend it to high school kids and up This book has extensive and sophisticated vocabulary
What a fantastic story I couldn't put it down It was such an emotional rollercoaster of love worry life death encouragement It was absolutely beautiful in every way
The Fault in Our Stars is a love story a life story--a beautiful glimpse of all that is right in the universe through the eyes of teens wise way beyond their short years
Although it made me cry more than I've ever cried while reading a book this story touched my heart I've never read a book so meaningful and real It was truly astounding
but bittersweet  My grandson urged me to read this before we see the movie next month  His 13 year old mentality thought this book was one of the best books he ever read
This book was beautiful and heartbreaking I absolutely loved it and would recommend it to everyone The characters are amazing and the friendships they have are desirable
This book had a lot of unnecessary words or moments in it Sure some can relate and came highly recommended by friends that loved it but very predictable and no true grit
Romance and cancer It works John Green writes a very believable teen romance that never talks down to his audience Characters are full and dialog is written beautifully
Such a page turner and john greens syntax is like no other You'll laugh and cry Even though we are all not like the characters in the book I can relate to certain things
This book was amazing something I could read over and over again like hazel Grace read her book It's a book that I stayed up late to read It's a book I will not forget
I have nothing to say but to go read this book John Green is absolutely amazing He is able to capture ordinary life in a spectacular extraordinary way It is a must read
Get this book right now It is one of the best books I have ever read The movie is coming out soon so get it right now Its a quick read and you won't want to put it down
I love this book It is so beautifully written and keeps you intrigued with every page turn I absolutely recommend this book to everyone and I cannot wait for the movie
My daughter made me read this book and since she has amazing taste I agreed And she was right  It will change the way you think about life children illness and death
This book was an amazing read It really tought me some good ways to look at life You may not think it is so great but it is really the only best thing you are gonna get

Such a good book I thought the beginning was a little weird at first but it really draws you in I was crying my eyes out while on the train to and from work reading this
I cannot explain how much this changed my perspective on everything I have ever known Thus is the best book ever andi hope I am lucky enough to find my Augustus Waters
If you don't like sad books-RUN  However the journey was worth the pain  Beautifully written and thought provoking  Makes you want to live with the people in the room
I've never laughed sobbed and squirmed from butterflies that aren't mine from reading a book truly a wonderful piece of literature would recommend to anyone at any age
This book is different from what I usually like to read but I was hooked from the very beginning I finished the book in 3 days I teared up a lot so you know it's good :)
Unless you have time to read the whole book  You may not be able to put it downThis was a well written evocative story about the most unlikely tragic romance
every once in a blue moon a book comes along a book so perfect and so touching that it changes you this is that book it has deeply changed me it was simply brilliant
This book is definitely one of my favorites John Green is an amazing writer and person in general check him out on youtube and you'll find yourself a nerdfighter like me
It gives you a perspective what it's like to have cancer It doesn't matter if you've taken care of someone or knew someone with cancer It's a sad topic with a lot of wit
I have recommended this book to everyone  and they all love it I can't wait for the movie This book is written so well I cried I laughed  I fell in love with Augustus
I haven't read such an amazingly inspiring tragic yet beautiful book in a long time and it was quite refreshing I cried but the tears were worth the book times infinity
Its so fantastic I finished the book in a week tops and Im going to re read it I highly suggest it to anyone Its not just a dumbbook for teenagers John Green is amazing
I loved this book  It was brilliant  John Green took a long time to write this book and it was obvious  Every word was placed well every line every bit   flawless
I cried so hard at the end of this book It is incredibly touching and really makes up think about life I recommend this book to everyone John Green is a freaking genius
This book was amazing Cover to cover This book is a definite ate Must read(: it really makes you feel what the characters feel and fall in love with them as you go along
This is considered a young adult book and while I do think young adults would enjoy it as an adult I really thought it was amazing as well  I recommend this for everyone
This is an incredible love story that shows when faced with life's inevitable challenges one can still experience the importance of being in love and being loved in return
I loved this book I read it while recovering from an illness (major to me minor in comparison) and it was what I needed Beautiful tale so heartbreakingin a good way
This is a great book I am a teenager and John Green has got everything right in this book the dialect the feelings everything I would highly recommend reading this
Thoroughly enjoyed the book Not at all what I was expecting There were times I don't think I was following the author but still a delightful read Couldn't put it down
Beautiful sad story Worth reading before seeing the movie or heck read it after and compare the details left out and the nuances and moments that are missed in the movie
This book was great It got my emotions rolling and didn't stop The ending was not what I expected and that just made the book  This is a book I will read again one day
I really enjoyed this book I'd never read a book from the point of view of a teen fighting cancer It was heartbreaking and inspiring without being sappy in the least
Possibly a teenagers novel but no it is just as deep as Tuesdays With Morrie So if there is someone that is doubtful about why leaving is worth then this is the book
Very good book Even though the story is about a very young couple any age can relate to this tender love story Having recovered from cancer it touched my heart deeply
This really made me think long after I stopped reading it each evening I loved all the characters and the way it slowly built towards where you needed to go emotionally
I loved everything about this book the way it was written the characters everything I would recommend it to anyone under the age of 30-35 Read it you won't be sorry
The writer John Green is amazingThis book has everything I enjoySuch as: romance suspense etcI don't want to be a spoiler alert so go and read it
I smiled I laughed i cried Well bawled my eyes out Okay Okay Everything I could ever hope in a book Although if I could rewrite it Just the ending I might lol
We never know what a cancer patient goes through and the things that they have to deal with And even is a love story is sad too Made cry a lot but I will read it again
Sharp and clean this novel does a fantastic job of cutting through the Hollywood smoke of heroism and delves into the painful truth of life: that we all die and it hurts
I read this book with the desire to watch the movie it is a well thought out book with real life personality and emotionI can not wait to read more from this author
I really liked this book It made me laugh and it made me cry I felt like I would have liked to know Hazel Grace and Augustus But maybe not the story was just so great
Good book quick easy read I know it's a young adult book but as a 26 year old I have no shame in saying I read it and enjoyed it :) (Okay and I cried during it too)
Having watched my mother die of cancer and my little brother die of CF this book brought back the joy and pain of loving them so much Loss is life to live is the dream
I loved this book I didn't cry but when I read it I get attached to it SEE THE MOVIE Read the book before the movie because if you don't you will ruin the emotions
Sad but good story Having had a niece with cancer in her teens I was interested to read what it might be like from a terminal point of view Thank God hers was not
On death and dying with the emotional turmoil of teens grown old and wise in their unfair suffering The lead character learns  to love and be loved before it is too late
Great book A page turning laugh out loud tear jerking well-written book My daughter and I read it (slowly I might add) We are awaiting the movie to arrive at Redbox
Sophisticated teenage love story that was more mature than many adult relationships A joy but sad story Makes you want to experience that level type of love Inspiring
Well written and well paced Your relationship develops with the characters as theirs does  You feel their love grow and as the author wrote without pain there is no joy
This was a sad story The only truth in the book the only one who got the Big Picture is 6 year old Antonietta Meo who truly is in The Literal Heart of Jesus Okay
This is an amazing book I loved reading it John Green is an amazing writer and one neat fact he lives in my home town I give this book and John Green a 5 star rating
I bought this book and couldn't put it down I read it in 24 hrs The witty romantic dialogue is amazing to read Such believable characters I must go see the movie now
What a wonderful book my granddaughter shared with me  I smiled a lot  cried a little  and I did lots of thinking about life in general I surely recommend this book 
I like how you made her think on the bright side of life I would recommend this book to all my friends and family I rated it five stars because I really enjoyed the book
It was a very emotional book with ups and downs Personally I loved this book As Augustus Waters one said  I'm in a roller coaster that only goes up my friend
This book showed me a new way to look at the world It showed me that anyone can love And some other people are better at it than some of us But it showed me a good time
This book was sorrowful amazing hopeful and joyous all at the same time I rate this 5 stars because it was a beautiful story and beautifully written I love this book
Overall it was a good book It is definitely geared toward an adolescent reader It was hard for me to get into at first and then when I did get into it the book was over
Beautifully written tragic love story  I loved the characters could really identify with them and loved the story line I would recommend this book a hundred times over
I loved this book so much even though I cried my eyes out through the last half of it it's the most original love story I've ever come across and I like that very much &lt;3
I loved the way that the characters were developed I liked them all very much I don't usually want to read sad books but I wanted to read this one &amp; I'm glad that I did
Great book  Loved every page of it  Hard to put it down to do other things  Really enjoyed reading it  Looking forward to seeing the movie this weekend with my family
I love this book so much It's has an amazing concept  of two people with cancer but thats only the backround of the book its mostly about how much they love each other
A sad and beautiful love storyLovely characters I of course would love to see that Hazel Grace goes on to live a full life Always carrying the legacy of Augustus
Hazel &amp; Augustus are a love story for the ages that only lasted a few moments A haunting tale from the eyes of a dying child that has reached the age of self-realization
This is a book i reccomend for anyone in middle school and up Very interesting i finished it in less than five days I was addicted definatly worth the $5 i spent on it
kept my interest but ended with questions wondering what happens Will check out the movie next but one I will wait for DVD to come out not one I want to see in theater
This book is so true and accurate it renewed my joy It says everything I have ever wanted to say and explained everything I have ever felt Wonderful most wonderful read
I love this book so much it's like the awesomeness book in the world I love it so much you shod reed it btw it gets sad in the end  I hope you have fun feeding bye  :)
What a great and inspiring read The love story between Gus and Hazel is sweet and sad at the same time Grab some tissues and get read to stay up late to finish the book
Sarcastic intelligent humor tied into a beautiful love story I enjoyed every last page Highly recommend if you're looking for a nice (potentially emotional) quick-read
Best bookstorymovie ever So movingbeautifulheart warming  very emotional don't normally cry but the story about hazel and Gus just rips your heart out Number one
Grab your tissue this is a definite tear jerker The story is great but Hazel's perspective on having Cancer is AMAZING This book could be great inspiration to readers
I'm so impress with this book I feel as if this was a real story I absolutely fell in love with almost every character I give more the 5 stars I give it infinite stars
One of the best books I have read in a long time  I couldn't put it down  A story about 2 teenagers falling in love  I would recommend this book to anyone and everyone
Great story with wonderful quotes and deep metaphors that make you stop and think about life death and the passivity that becomes us when we don't have a battle to fight
I absolutely loved this book and wanted to ensure that I finished it before the movie was released I can't wait to see it on film Excellent book loved loved loved it
So many quotable sentences with awesome insights No problems were solved but life was looked at from a completely different perspective Life is not ruled by a calendar
I loved the story behind this book  Not just for teens for young adults and adults as well  Highly recommended A great book that is likely to bring tears to your eyes
My thoughts are stars I can't fathom into constellations-Augustus WatersJohn Green is a fantastic writer I enjoyed this book very much
I hate reading I always have but this book was so fascinating from the first page I couldn't put it down A great read I couldn't imagine someone not liking this book
My Grandaughter told me about this book  She liked the book and said zi would like it to  She was right  what a beautiful story  Can't wait till the movie is released
I really enjoyed this book It has been particularly awesome to share it with sharemy teenage daughter Brought up wonderful conversations Beautifully written And clever
This book had a certain authenticity to the voice that is characteristic of good writing I was totally drawn in and finished the novel in one day Definitely a must read
This book made me laugh and cry It was probably the best book I have read recently I wish there would be a sequel to it so we could find out what happens to Hazel Grace
If I didn't already subscribe to the philosophies presented in this novel I would be convinced to after having been exposed to them in such a real and compelling context
Recommended by my granddaughters I found it to be an interesting and informative view on teenage cancer as seen through the eyes of a 16 year old  Bring lots of tissues
I enjoyed this book it made me realize how precious life is The love story between Gus and Hazel was so sweet have a tissue handy Hope the movie does the book justice
A true love story always remembering love comes first and pain comes lastTruly recommended to everyone who needs to be reminded to live everyday to the fullest cx
Even crying felt good I laughed more that what I cried The writing is sweet and awesome and the complete view of this makes a fun book out of a star-crossed-lovers story
I read this book at the recommendation of my middle school students She said I would need a dictionary to understand it She forgot that I am 50 yes old I love the book
My granddaughter read this book and loved it She recommended it to me so I'm reading it now  It is a teen genre but very touching Haven't finished it yet but it's good
Beautiful story in where courage determination and hope are present  This story of two young adults teach our kids many lessons such as never lose hope during hard time
I really enjoyed reading this book because the characters seemed so real and the author seemed genuine It was a quick read which Is a good thing because it was emotional
This book is now my favorite book I have ever read It's the perfect love story &amp; I cried like a baby I hope to find someone to love just as much as Hazel loved Augustus
This book was absolutely amazing never read anything like it I recommend this book to everyone I don't usually read much but I read this book in three days Speechless
This book really wholeheartedly keeps one reading until the end I would recommend this book to anyone I've lost loved ones to cancer so I could relate to the characters
This book is incredible A must read by far romantic sad and incredible doesn't even sum up John Green's amazing novel Honestly this book changed me it's that good
This book will capture your attention your heart and your mind immediately It is perhaps better suited for adult readers rather than youth due to its sensitive content
I will keep this book with me for years to come and pass along to anyone I can It really changed my outlook on a lot of things and it's all thanks to those two teenagers
This is the best book I have ever read I loved every single thing about this book it was perfect I was honestly bawling my eyes out I recommend this book for everyone
This book is very good romantic and Tetris it's one of the best books I've read I recommend it for 10 year or up because of some scenes in this book may not be appropriate
One of the best book I have ever read You want to cry but you find yourself smiling at the way they handle themselves in every situation The book is beautifully written
This is my daughter's favorite book of all times  She has two copies  The first one she lends out to all she demands read the book and the other sits on her night stand
It's a good story Not all sunshine and happy times Like life bad things happen yet small things work themselves out This book made me bawl I loved it Worth the read
I hardly know what to say I knew it would be a painful read I didn't know it would glow in my heart the way it did You owe it to yourself to read this magnificent book
most amazing book I have ever read I myself being a survivor much similar to a cancer  like isaacs can relate and understand the book I highly suggest this book to anyone
After hearing multiple people talk about how great this book was I finally read it I was not disappointed I read the entire book in one sitting This is a great story
This is my favorite book Hazel is such a sweet character I was overwhelmed with joy when she first met Augustus By th  end of the book I was crying like a little baby
This is one of the few books that my teenagers read first They loved it then begged me to read it too so we could talk about the material I couldn't put this book down
This is the first John Green novel I've read and I'm about to look for more A beautifully written poignant story about teen life love and death This story made me cry
This was the best first book I bought on my kindle I would gladly look back at this book and read it again and again The realistic yet amazing love and story blew me away
I loved The Fault In Our Stars It was really sad but it was still a very good story I couldn't put it down for 2 days It was so much more than okay
This book was actually recommended to me by 13-yr old daughter It is beautifully written and unbelievably sad And yet the story is so well told it is worth the tears
This is a really good book  I started reading it just because a friend recommended to me at the end I was so grateful  It has a message and teack to appreciate the life
Very touching book but it was also pretty funny It's definitely a different spin on this type of genre All of the characters will definitely pull at your heartstrings
This book is a life changer it's not another sappy teen Romance to suffer through It's incredibly helpful to read when dealing with pain Great book thanks John Green
I had doubts about whether I would like it due to thinking it was more on a teenager level  I did not see the movie but enjoyed the book and the author's writing style
This book was a required reading for a college class  If I were a teenager I probably would have enjoyed it  I am not a teenager  I found the book totally unappealing
Beautiful story worth the time  Highly recommended  Will look for more from this author  The movie was just as lovely as the novel  Well done pain demands to be felt
Amazing character development that makes you laugh cry smile and frown (if you're into romantic comedies) I recommend this book to anyone who wants to read a page turner
sad but good Timeless story but in a refreshing modern setting Good for young adults and adults Just about everyone is touched by cancer so very relatable for all
This book inspires you to help the less fortunate It helps to realize the pain others are going through Even though the pain we still live and go through more and more
I was so sad that he didn't give more hope I thought he was a Christian  and someone who knows The Lord should point people to the hope of heaven and their purpose here
I didn't want to get caught up in the hype of the book or movie but after a while I gave in  It was way better than I thought and I thoroughly enjoyed it  I rare treat
Not only did this have an interesting plot it also told the story of being a cancer survivor  One minute you are crying and the next you are laughingGreat story
An excellent book that is a tear jerker at times  Very well written where you can't help but to get into the characters world of living with cancer  Highly recommended
I must admit that I watched the movie first and never intended to read the book I'M so glad I did This book was real raw and very well written I highly recommend it
I chose this rating bc the book has a lot of interesting parts in itI liked the part where they travel to Amsterdam to find out what happens at the end of the book
It starts off slow but then it's amazing and it's not cheesy like where they both survive and they live happily ever after and that crap it's realistic and I like that ‚ù§Ô∏è
Wonderful book And unlike most movies based on the book I found it to be very similar with many parts using the exact lines from the book I didn't want to put it down
I love this book I will make everyone read this and I love my mom for letting me read it and for her to keep fighting her cancer I give it this rate because it's the best
What a great story I cried the whole timeeven when I read it at work haha I would recommend this to everyone Very insightful on the psychology that comes with cancer
A diificult subject has been handled excellently It is devoid of the usual tear-jerk attitude that goes with the subject of terminal illness but gives food for thought
I laughed smiled and cried and any other emotion that comes to mind Makes you see a new perspective to young love Great read for anyone Make sure to have the tissues
Interesting concept Very moving at times Plot install that believable and feels very rushed especially around the end Enjoyed reading once probably won't read again
A very genuine sweet story A good reminder to those of us who lead normal lives that we should learn to cherish the small moments A good read and lesson for all ages
This book was beautifully written A complete turn in  events but kept you wanting more Definitely puts an impact on the fact that we should cherish every day as humans
I am in late 30's and picked this up because the movie was coming out  I read it in 3 hours in one night  Couldn't put it down  Very sweet story  I really enjoyed it
It was very funny but very heartfelt I think that everyone should read the book and the movie but make sure that you bring some tissues it really touched my heart
Warning:  the ending of this book may catch you off guard as it did me  This is a sad poignant book but with a message of self-sacrifice that makes it hard to put down
This was a wonderful book to kick off our book club  I definitely recommend this book I looked forward to getting anytime I could get to read this even forgoing sleep
Such a lovely look at life and death thru eyes of intelligent teens  Wise and compassionate they were but so believable  I am eager to meet author Green in another book
Beautifully written leaves you laughing and crying I have  lot of the book highlighted because there are so many amazing concepts and idea written in eloquent language
I have read this book 10 times over and each is as exhilarating as the last  maybe even more so  I strongly suggest reading this book if you have not  a very good read
This book made me laugh and cry I loved the development of the relationship between Hazel and Gus It was beautiful and makes you remember that life is so unpredictable
Loved itnow would like to see the movieand will take tissues  Having gone through losing a soul mate to Cancer I found this book both emotional and entertaining
Such a great story The humour in this read is what makes the story Hazel and Gus relationship is heart warming Even though it is sad at times it's well worth the read
great reading I thoroughly enjoyed it  could barely put down my kindle only 4 stars because I'm waiting for the one that makes me want to read the book at least 5 times
I really enjoyed reading this and am looking forward to the movie Such a great inspiration to anyone going through a situation that feels like it is beyond our control
Great modern love story; with excellent character development This author makes you stop and think about your relationships This story makes you fall in love with love
Sad story but beautifully written Could hardly put it down  Lots of memorable lines believable characters compelling love story I understand what the hype was about
I bought this book and both of my daughters read it They absolutely enjoyed it and immediately went and watched the movie theater According to them it was a tearjerker
Poignant different in the approach to the terminally ill  Gave me an insight into the daily struggle that cancer patients live and the effect on the family and friends
Forever a work of truth and sadness I've cried reading this novel yes but isn't that a thing of real life also This book is truly amazing and forever will be amazing
This book perfectly brought out several emotions Love Sadness Joy etc The Fault in Our Stars was everything I could have imagined and more Definitely a 5 star book
I couldn't put it down and I've never been so connected to a book before Aside from bawling my eyes out I fell in love and will find myself reading this again and again
I thought it was well written I was completely immersed in the characters I felt like I knew them It did leave me feeling very sad and I cannot get them out of my mind
I loved reading this book So easy to get wrapped up in the characters and feel what they feel It's just short enough that you can read it in a day and that's perfect :)
My daughter age 12 loved this book She really enjoyed the dark humor She found some of the language uncomfortable (swearing) because she hasn't had much exposure to it
I actually enjoyed most of this book It did feel like it was written for the teenage set with all intent of it being made into a screenplay but I enjoyed it nonetheless
Absolutely breathtaking A wonderful book Could not put it down read it as straight through as possible while going about daily work tasks Will read over and over again
Ok I'm a dude and very straight but my girlfriend got me to read this book and I ended up loving it but there has to be an ending it can't be like AIA that's not fair
How relevant is this book  Read it for a different point of view - from the cancer patient who is a teen and just wants to be normal Stuck with me after the final page
I really enjoyed this book I laughed and cried and remembered not to take life for granted We never know what breath may be our last Great read with excellent writing
I loved this book  I couldn't put it down I could relate to so much of it having a son who died of leukemia  I will definitely order this for my middle school library
Not something I would normally read but im so glad I did  What a great book Beautifully written Look forward to reading more from john green Can't wait for the movie
I am the kind of person who doesn't like it when people pulls out the cancer card But book is so well written and sweet and sad and everything you ever want from a book
everything about it was perfect I can't think of a way to make it better I strongly recommend it for anyone who has 2 days to kill because you won't want to put it down
What is life It is nothing without the Fault in Our Stars I both hate and love it alongside it's sacred author John Green That is all I can say regarding the matter
This book was amazing Such great writing by the author Once I started reading it I couldn't stop It's one of my new favorites It's a must read I highly recommend it
I never write reviews but this was amazing It questions every aspect of life and death and whether either is meaningful Amazing book brought me to tears multiple times
Interesting story about two young people and the challenges they faced when dealing with a terrible disease  The author really dug into some of the phsycological issues
This book was EXCELLENT  It definitely left an imprint on me and I will read it again  I love books that touch my heart and make me laugh and crythis book delivered
Best  book I've ever read could never put it down Finished it in a day which is very rare in my case because I don't read many books This was  an amazing work of art
One of the best books I've read in a long time I finished almost two weeks ago and it still lingers with me You will laugh and cry and learn some things from this book
I loved this book John Green made you picture everything that was going on This book gave me a few tears and smiles but this was so far the best book I have ever read
this book caught my attention from the start and kept me there til the end it was great and although it's quite sad finishing the book was a must and I don't regret it
The story is immediately captivating holding the reader hostage in the best possible way A thoughtful stryline with intriguing charcters and some memorable one-liners
I have read this book so many times and I haven't had enough of it It makes me think we actually can have hope like Hazel and Augustus had and every fear is an oblivion
every once in awhile a book makes you stop everything you are doing and just read This is that book I did not want the book to end for fear of what was going to happen
I honestly can say that was the best book I have every read This book left a mark on me in a way nothing else can Definitely telling EVERYONE about it Well done John
This book is beautifully written and quite inspiring It's been a long time since I've finished a book in a day but I just couldn't put this one down A true must-read
A compelling emotional read You will fall in love with Hazel and Gus The author perfectly portrays the angst of being a teen without making the characters intolerable
I enjoyed reading this greatly The ending caught me of guard completely and I spent hours crying because of how attached I hit to the characters This is an amazing book
It is nearly impossible to write a funny feel-good book about children with cancer John Green has succeeded My only complaint is that the book is not five times longer
I have felt every emotion while reading this book It is beautifully written; everything about it is beautiful I am looking forward to reading more of Mr Green's books
This was great Loved the characters their supporting characters and the style the writer brought to the story I choose Woody Harrelson to play the jerky Dutch author
This book has touched me personally since I have known a person with cancer who has passed This is a truly amazing book and this is one of the best books I've ever read
it's a good message but the ending is sooooooooooooo sad I still love the bookyou need to read this book an tell me you didn't cryif you didn't you don't have feelings
I will never forget the deep sentiment in this bookI cried so muchI will neverever forget this bookI am so glad I got go on this rollercoaster that is always going up
This much loved young adult book deserves high praise It is funny heartbreaking and deeply compassionate Augustus and Hazel will be with me for years to come I imagine
My 12 year old daughter read this last year and LOVED IT I recently read it and loved it too Even cried at the end A wonderful read for young adults and their parents
I loved the way Green wrote his book like a screenplay It was so easy to connect and fall in love with the characters I feel like a better person for reading this book
This book is not for everyone It's real and will break your heart  You will fall in love with Hazel and Augustus Very well written Best book I've read in a long time
An amazingly tragic love story I can only dream of being half as awesome as these characters Funny and heartbreaking This story will stay with me for a very long time
A very touching teenage love story  The characters were multidimensional as they dealt with the very difficult subject of childhood cancer and life changing experiences
What an adorable story Very well written and entertaining  An enjoyable read despite the moments of pure heartbreak John Green 's novel appeals to readers of all ages
This is an interesting story concept I did enjoy reading it My daughter and I love to read books then watch the movie I will say the book is way better than the movie
This is a great teen book as well as an adult book It was really difficult to put down It is definitely one of those books worth the time to read even for busy people
I read this book and I loved it The weird thing is I'm only 9 years old and it makes me ant to read it more and more times I think this was the tenth time I read it
I enjoyed this book very much The characters were believable and engagingthe story about cancer patients was sympathetic but not maudlin I recommend this book highly
I have read this book twice it was one of the most wonderful love story and emotional one i have read in a long time John Green created a inspirational and loving book
This is the best ever book on the world not only did it make me laugh it made me cry the best book that I've ever read and I've read enough books to fill 20 libraries
I've really been entwined with the characters and felt sad and happy when major events happened I felt the pain and struggle within the story It's sweet and beautiful
I liked this book more than I thought I would Has some very sad moments but I guess that's expected for a book about teens with cancer All together it was a good read
Thoughtful funny realistic and heart-breaking Beautifully written A book that will have you thinking for a long time A wonderful albeit incredibly sad experience
I had to read this to see what all the fuss was about and found out that it was all that people said it was The story is sweet but sad and happy all at the same time
I love this book it's was so deep and had wonderful quotes I simply loved it Even though I would loved to have more about there love I understand that he was too sick
I have seen the movie both are brilliant But the book I feel is way more feelings You don't just read it You feel the characters Get more into their heads Love it
Love it This is so touching and just so amazing I couldn't even put it down I was hooked from the first page to the last I would recommend this book to anybody 10/10
I loved this book each chapter left you wanting moreI recommend this book to people who liked If I Stay by Gayle Forman and the Divergent series by Veronica Roth
Beautifully written captured my attention through it's entirety What an interesting take on the emotional turmoil that ensues during the battle of one's life Amazing
What a beautiful way to share that story It was very hard for me to put down but I also felt sad when it ended Thank you for providing some realism on a tough subject
Even though the story is sad and bound to make you cry at times as it deals with terminal cancer in teenagers it is told in a way that makes it nevertheless enjoyable
I appreciate how consistent all the relationships were in this novel Love reluctantly unmasked is ugly truth and made a fine spectacle of itself through two teenagers
Wonderful wonderful book Made me step out of my life of little worries and realize the reality for many Very humbling and an inspiration to live your best life today
Couldn't put it down  I highly recommend it  Written very realistically  I found the book to be extremely thought-provoking  Just the kind of book I was looking for
The characters and the story feel so real  It's a sad story but a great one  Don't skip this story just because you don't want to deal with the sadness it's worth it
OMG such a beautiful story that I did not want to put down I was so gut wrenched yet felt so at peace A must read for all ages ~*~*~*~*~*Five Twinkling Stars~*~*~*~*~
Great book that is easily relatable for anyone in their 20's  I laughed and cried and flew through the book in under 4 days  I recommend this to people ages 13 and up
This book was both sad and beautiful  One must factor in a box of tissues in the cost of the book  It is a story of love that doesn't die and yes it is about cancer
This is such an amazing story that I would read again and again and again Although while you are reading the twentieth chapters make sure to have some tissues with you
I loved it even after seeing the movie because of the depth of characters and environment via rich wording that no movie will ever be able to reach  Kudos Mr Green
Got it because my 12 year old heard about it and wanted to see the movie She really liked the book I read it not expecting much and ended up enjoying the book myself
The fault in our stars is very inspirational the beautiful love story of to teenagers with cancer a great book to read with a box of tissues snuggled in the bed at night
Great Beach read Read this book while on vacation with my family After hearing so much about the film I was excited to read the book I think it lived up to the hype
Being a young person with cancer I think this is a fantastic way to give others a peek into what life is like as the patient It's a beautiful story of love and courage
Although this book is really a young person read it was a captivating story  Full of surprises and a loving familyI recommend this book and then go see the movie
Loved the story line  To be honest when I first started reading it I was like Ugh it's going to be one of those books  Boy was I wrong  Great quick read
Sensitive portrayal of young love between terminally-ill teenagers Captures their ability to retain their sense of humour and adventure despite their uncertain futures
Fantastic book that is real and touches the heart For my daughter who is chronically ill it explains perfectly how those who are sick feel about the world around them
This book is seriously the best It makes you laugh and cry as well It's simply amazing I love the quotes nauseating that are used I couldn't wish for a better book
this book is so well written and an easy and enjoyable read I would recommend it to younger adults and teens but I think anyone could enjoy it very quotable and sweet
This is probably the best book I've ever read and it is also the worst cause I cried halfway through it  I loved this book so much and I can't wait to go see the movie
Loved the main characters Sweet love story about two people that truely deserved to find love Great insight into relationships between teenagers and parents and peers
Solid writing and a charming fast read I devoured this book in 4 dayseasily Definitely pulls at the heart strings while reminding us that we're all human and fragile
I liked this book and I am that glad I read it I'm looking forward to seeing the screen adaptation particularly since I like both the actors cast in the leading roles
i was touched by this story of a young girl who was taken from her family and friends much too soon i finished this book in two days and stayed up till 3am to finish
Possibly the best love story It isn't stuffy nor hard to read and will be love  by literally all ages If you're looking for a good laugh and an ugly cry look no more
Touching warm and a book worth your time to read You will take from it what you need to understand that life is a short gift worth enjoying for whatever it gives you
Amazing book Got emotional in the beginning but held back the tears and then toward the end the water works flooded my pillow Why just why did that happen Life huh
This book really makes you appreciate life and everything you have The book was great to read and you can never predict what happens next I couldn't put the book down
Well written thought provoking and though sad an enjoyable read I hope I love like this one day more importantly I hope my loved ones love and are loved like this
A heartfelt honest look at first (true) love An emotional journey that will keep you reading - and crying - to the end I will be recommending to all my friends
I think that everyone should read this book it is amazing and perfect and I can't even explain how much this book moved me everything about it is spot on and I love it
This book is utterly amazing It was very descriptive and emotional Although the book started off kinda slow I was still hooked I would recommend this book to anyone
Thoughtful and tear jerking Couldn't put the book down and finished it in two days Makes you painfully imagine life without your significant other in a very real way
Quick read but so powerfully I found myself laughing and crying along with the characters I sat on the edge of my seat waiting to hear how Hazel's favorite book ends
Decided to read the book when I saw the movie trailer Glad I did Such a well written book and so full of humor and emotion What a great story Really makes you think
The Fault in our Stars is a very good book Quick read however a real tear jerker keep the tissues handy Characters and story line are interesting and well developed
This amazing book inspired me to write to a dear friend  who is suffering from side effects of living' and let her know that I love her  A life changing book
I just can't explain it it's so good but sad and John Green amazing bookPS  This may not be a good thing but I balled my eyes out for 20 minutes after I finished
I love it It's a great book for teens adults and anyone else It's one of the best I've ever read it's the BEST I've ever read I definitely recommend this book
Dr Abe Maslow would have liked these unusually emotionally and spiritually self-actualizing young peopleLeonard PellettieriMA EnglishPhD Psychology
I cried most of the time in this book and even though it was sad Hazel still got to live her life Although hazel lived i was expecting her to die and Augustus to live
I bought it by an accident but i ended up reading the book At first i thought i was too old for ths since my age is waaaay passed teenage era But i ended up liking it
This was a great book  It had me hooked within the first few pages  The movie comes out next week and my daughter (who also read this book) and I can't wait to see it
I liked this book The main characters are more glib and clever in their dialogues than is believable but still it was thoughtful and touching I will go see the movie
I am not an avid reader but I could not put this book downI laughed cried and laughed some more  I may even read it againI can not wait to see the movie
I thoroughly enjoyed this book and am wanting more from this author I highly recommend to anyone who is into love stories without all the sappy stuff that goes with it
I didn't expect to enjoy this book as much as I did It is not my usual genre and I didn't think it could live up to its hype I should've had more faith in John Green
This book was one of the best i've read in a while But just like AIA I wish I knew what happened to her mom dad and Isaac Impeccably done Mr Green impeccably done
Like Hazel I too crave closure  I want to know what becomes of Hazel and her family and Isaac  This was an emotional tale of true love that knows no bounds  Amazing
I chose a 5 star rating because this story had it all love hate humor and tears I experienced each emotion while reading a well written story I couldn't put down
Laughed for most of the book Tears of happiness and sadness throughout A great read and good reminder to never stop enjoying life and the loving the ones you love
Enemies though this is a sad tale I enjoyed reading it  Realistic writing made using current vernacular made it feel fresh and current and pulls the reader into story
This book was very touching There was truth in it for anyone reading whether they have cancer or not I fell in love with each character and couldn't put the book down
Ifyou want a good perspective on illness this is a good book to read Those who have illnesses or are in the life of one who has an illness should definitely read this
heart felt story couldn't put it down  Read in a couple hours can't wait for the movieA story that can make you laugh cry and loose track of time is a keeper
This books was absolutely amazing I loved it I don't usually cry through books movie and tv but this really got me teary eyed It is definitely worth the read 10/10
My first try to read a foreign language book (Greek reader) I try it with this book because I knew that it will keep me to read it and so it does Waiting the movie
This is such a beautiful book I am a voice over actress and only wish I could have been a part of capturing this story in audio book form BravoCaley Rose
l absolutely love and admire this beautifully written book that was inspired by the very real Esther Earl lf you have a brain in your head and are humanyou will too
This book is a million times better than I thought it would be and I am so happy I read it  sometimes I smiled and I will admit that I did cry You must read this book
This book is easily five stars it can be a tear jerker right from the start I loved every minute of this book and everybody in their right mind should read this book
From beginning to end it sucked me in You will laugh and you will most certainly cry but it is worth the emotional roller coaster So grab a box of tissues and enjoy
I loved this book Loved it I enjoyed the wit and intellectual characters with deep emotion I loved the language throughout the book It was a lovely story all around
Loved it could not put down Very thought provokingCancer sucks any disease for that matter Interesting toread book written by a guy about a teenage girl
Its the most amazing book I have ever read I have read like hundreds of books and this one is so unique and refreshing but be warned you will cry and you will cry alot
Beautifully written The characters come alive I couldn't get enough of hazel's wit Highly recommend to teens and adults I haven't enjoyed a book this much in months
Beautifully written  It is a book for teenagers and adults  Very sensitive and thoughtful  It brings tears to my eyes just thinking of the love and loss they endured
This book is great From the quest to find her favorite author to the challenges of living with cancer you cheer for Hazel all the way through wanting her to succeed
the way John Green writes the story takes a new look into lives that both touches the heart and the mind if I had to choose to read a book I would read this one again
There are many lessons this book can teach someone some go over my head a bit But John Green's voice is a very real one and the characters are everlasting Wonderful
It was and still is so great in  a way I can't describe The emotions the detail it was all so beautiful and I did not want it to end Thank you John green Thank you
this book is amazing  this was my second time reading it and I fell in love with it all over again and I highly suggest this to gooey romantics  especially teenagers 
I really loved this novel it made me tear up and held my interest until the very end I did enjoy Looking for Alaska better however this book is amazing just the same
this book was amazing and very emotional It is at the same time funny and interesting There were some difficult words that I had to look up to understand the sentence
My daughter recommended this book to me I thoroughly enjoyed it It was so honest and true The author made me laugh and cry and I won't soon forget Hazel and Augustus
Great book  Cried like a baby through its entirety but loved it nonetheless  This is the first John Green book I've read and will happily be on the search for others
So cleverly written with the spunk and sass of teens who are enduring the unimaginable  An incredible story of love disappointment and life Oh I loved this story
The book is well written and it's a good story But it is very sad Young people are already depressed and think about death too much I would not recommend it to teens
I enjoyed reading the book It was not as cheesy as I thought it would be which is always good I think it is a great book that everyone should read when they are young
This is an awesome book It's about a 16 year old girl with terminal cancer who falls in love It's funny sad and entertaining I would definitely recommend this book
How short it really can be this book gives true meaning to its not the # of years in your life but the life in your yearsyou will shed many tears but worth the read
Teens have plenty of problems without medical issues but this book handles both with insight and sensitivity I liked it enough to give to my 14 year old granddaughter
After a two year waiting period John Green has done it again with his most recent masterpiece The Fault in Our Stars His compelling use of wit humor and a captivating plot gives him the rightful title of a New York Times Bestselling AuthorThe Fault in Our Stars tells the tale of Hazel Grace Lancaster who is a 16-year-old girl diagnosed with terminal cancer and her encounter with Augustus Waters a 17-year-old patient in remission They meet at a cancer support group and become fascinated with each other (to say the least) beginning a beautiful friendship and selfless romantic relationshipGreen gives readers an inside perspective of a terminally ill teenager and does a fantastic job of creating bittersweet and authentic characters Having the position of #1 on the New York Times Bestseller list for at least two weeks assures readers that this is a book to capture your attention and your heart strings
The is the best book I have read in quite awhile Complex nuanced I could not put it down It tackles very difficult subject matter with grace sensitivity and truth
I had waited to see the movie until I read the book It was amazing I wish we could all love like this Without seeing flaws and abnormality Without a second thought
Well done Addresses the fact that we are all going to die As someone who is currently fighting an incurable cancer I thought the perspective was incredibly well done
I think this book was overhyped or probably i went to read it with high expectations  The theme and the dialogues were good but did not captivate my attention enough
Loved this book Such a great story about two young people falling in love while the world is completely against them The movie was great too but read the book first
I thought this book may be teenager-y it isn't  Getting older I think most of us struggle with what our legacy will be  This book helped me put that in perspective
Loved it  but the book was so much richer as they often are The depth of the characters the brief glimpses of sunlight through the clouds Beautiful and bittersweet
I liked the book But the ending was hard to take I understood it because the story in the book had the same type of ending I would like to know what happens to hazel
Definitely 5 stars this is a Love story I've never heard of It's a very beautiful book and it has many messages in it only certain people understand I love this book
I absolutely loved this book  My niece was reading it for school and told me about it  I'm so glad I read it  Very honest and I was laughing out loud in many places
John Green has written a wonderful book where young readers will be reminded of empathy compassion for others and heart through this dramatic love story Well done
It may be filed under YA but its a great read for adults too I laughed I cried (well teared up anyway) John Green is a talented writer Thoroughly enjoyed this book
In enjoyed reading this book because of the honesty of the people involved The tragedy of cancer in children was shown in such a real way and in a real life situation
This story is profound  I lost a friend to brain cancer just 10 months ago and the feelings and fears are sooo real  Not only to the inflicted but those left behind
Love this book Don't love all his books But this one and looking for Alaska are great Read this book It's Awesome ( so is Looking For Alaska Read that one too) 
I was disappointed that the ending did not mention what happened to Hazel  I enjoyed the book very much and made me think about a lot of issues about cancer and dying
Great read &amp; fast Was good would rate it a 3 1/2  Definitely makes you realizeWe all know we're going to die Some of us just don't know how we will pass
This book opened my eyes to what real love is like This book is the most amazing emotional book ever I highly recommend this book to anyone Absolutely breathtaking
He tells the story from the young people's view saying and acting they would Great job Indiana is where I live also and I know the places and roads he speaks of üòáüòè
Enjoyed the book better than the movie  Very moving emotional and touching  Written with great sensitivity and good taste  I was moved by the book and recommend it
Book was clean and came in nice packaging Honestly this is John Greens best books Personally the rest of his books are terrible but this one destroyed me in the feels
Wow Real honest beautifulfunnyheartbreaking too shortLoved every pageUnexpected but satisfying endingI'm grateful I chose to read it
I love this book it would reccomend ages 12 and up cause of the language and some things that happen this is my favorite book and I saw the movie before I read the book
The Fault in Our Stars is a great read It kinda makes you think twice before taking life for granted Live for today as you never know what or who you loose tomorrow
I read this book just after publication  It was one of the best books I have read in some time  The characters emotions were so vivid to this reviewer  Well written
I really enjoyed this book I loved how John Green captured the teen feelings and all that goes on in their lives (with or without cancer)Didn't want this book to end
Given all the hype specially with some trusted friends being so happy with it I picked up this book with a lot of expectations However I am nothing but disappointed
Definitely a tear jerker Read it before the movie came out Some parts I felt that Green dragged on too much But overall I think this is a must-read Opens your eyes
This book was impossible to put down Although you will probably tear up at many parts in the book it is worth it to know the story of these two Definitely recommend
The fault in our stars is a beautifully written love story that will keep you looking I never stopped This book is a one of a kind John Green is a very talented man
This book is amazing because it isn't a sappy love story -- it hits home It is amazing and sheds light on life and how it is perceived through different perspectives
This book is so good There are many moments of beautiful uses of languages  There are passages that I had to read again and again  It was an excitingbeautiful read
I wanted to read the book before I saw the movie It was recommended by a Friend  I THOUGHT it was a touching story of a universal fear and the ways to cope with loss
Warning: Do not read before picture day or an important event Side effects include puffy eyes a heavy heart altered mood and a reminder that love is worth the risk
I have to say im a bookworm Give me a kindle w/all my favorite books on it (a whole LOT of books) and they wont amount to how much i LOVE tfos Such an adorable book
The book was beautifully written Made me cry made me laugh I read it over and over again just to experience the stunning literature given to us by my favorite author
Pleasantly surprised  Recommended to me by a total stranger Took her up on it and even though it was totally out side the genre I typically read I really enjoyed it
While this is supposedly a young adult novel I think it is interesting to all ages  It opens up a dreaded disease to the irreverence and humor that accompanies youth
It was a make you think differently story  Kept my interest  Several times it was sad but in a different way  I think everyone should put this book on the must read
The book revolves around a fictitious book The characters complain about the ending - then end this book EXACTLY the same way errrrgggggA good young adult book
This book was  a very well written book and I cried at the end Hazel and Gus' love story is one of the best I've read I would recommend this book for ages 15 and up
I really enjoyed reading this book  It really made me think about how a young adult would view the world and process what was happening to them I disliked the ending
This book was very touching and I loved it I myself have lost someone to cancer so I understand and just a warning you should buy a box of tissues along with this book
having lost love one's this book although fiction helped me to see and feel in a different perspective  I love a book that helps and keeps me thinking would recommend
Another quaint read by John Green Really enjoyed the characters and the overall depth of the story Augustus and Isaac were great people that Hazel needed in her life
The book was great  so was the movie If you read the book first you might be able to hold it together in the movie maybe Both are guaranteed to bring you to tears
I LOOOOVE THIS BOOK it is so perfect because people just think that teens with cancer have no lifes but they may have more of a love life then you hazel and gus did
There are simply no words to properly describe how wonderful this book is 5+++ heartbreaking &amp; beautiful stars for Mr Green Love love Gus &amp; Hazel Okey Okey‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è
This was the best book I have ever read I cried at the end it was very touching You really feel Hazels pain This is an amazing book John green did a wonderful job:)
This book was more moving than any I have read before it I could not put it down even when it moved me to tears I laughed I cried and most of all I opened my eyes
John green does an amazing job on this one He is so descriptive and I love It Also it is so realistic (at least more than others) It's hard to find a book like this
Heart wrenching easy read book that you can't put down John Green created an amazing book which was crafted into a make sure you bring a whole box if Kleenex movie
Did Hazel die or not I'm confused but yet that book was wonderful and brilliant Is An Imperial Affliction Van Houten' s life story I don't know but I love this book
It's been a long time since I've read a story that made me cry Not just teary-eyes I'm talking sob like a baby crying Love this story It tugged at my heart strings
I have no wordsI'm glad I didn't know much about the story before I read it it gutted me to my core I'm not sure I could watch the movie I'm forever changed
I'm in love with this book Thank you for living john green ‚ù§Ô∏èüòç This book was not only creative but it is so easy to fall in love with I couldn't put this book down
This book is amazing I feel as though this book is the modern Romeo and Juliet Because of this book girls no longer look for their Romeo they look for their Agustus
The Fault in Our Stars is that kinda of book that inspire you to look at life in a new way and don't take anything for grantedLet's live today Okay Okay
It is my favorite book everalthough I am only 11and will probably have more favorites when I am their age(Hazel and Augustus) I will always keep this book on my list
Great It was a heart felt story and romantic all the way It makes you laugh and cry but in the end you feel like you understand the universe just a little bit better
5 stars for romancefor sadfor happyfor loving each other no matter whatfor a happy sad and romantic storyThis novel is for people who love tragic love stories
This book was really good I really enjoyed it and read all weekend which I never do This is one of the best books I have read so far ans I cannot wait foe the movie:)
I both laughed out loud and felt my heart break This book is truly beautiful and will allow any to ponder on the bigger questions of life that is if you'll let it
Beautiful touching startling funny wonderful The ending was a bit sudden I didn't expect certain things to happen in this book That's what made it so intriguing
What a great book Every once in a while you come across a book that truly touches your heart Every character built in this book is a reason to read itLOVE IT
Well written witty novel I laughed I cried and I couldn't put it down What a wonderful read John Green has a way with words Hoping the movie will be just as good
This book is simply amazing The writing the evolution of emotion that spews from each page I've never been more (personally) connected to another book in my life
It was a good book I enjoyed the charactersThere was a lot of hype around the book not sure why it took a while to get into it for me Overall I would recommend it
I can't wait to see the movie now It is a love  story of two young souls that may not of lived life  long enough but the life they lived was profound and full of love
This was quite possibly the most moving book I've readGreen so brilliantly finds voices for his characters in this book and touched my soul with his prose
It made me laugh and cry at the same time To capture our humanness with its flaws and beauty Thank you for this emotional and psychologically grounded roller coaster
Such an amazing book Definitely recommended for anyone who is a sucker for love stories It's a I can't put this down yet type of book The best kind of book
Although the writing is simple there is a lot of thought to this novel Ignore the writing style and focus on the actual language and you have yourself an actual book
A phenomenal encounter of vivid emotions tied together with an unprecedented youthfulness You know it's coming yet fully indulge and immerse yourself in it as you go
Great story it has mixed emotions during their love Story Another read again for sure My cousin talked me into reading it and I wouldn't want to unread it thanks CPUs
The fault in Our Stars is such a good book I couldn't put it down Not only was it an easy read but it also had a great message as to how we should all live our lives
I thought this book was a sweet story and being a cancer survivor myself I can personally say that this is a very accurate depiction of the emotions that are involved
A poignant love story that I found hard to put down  It evoked a mix of emotions from joyful to sad and portrayed the triumph of the human spirit  I loved this book
I kept hearing how great this book waswell it was just okay I wouldn't recommend it It wasn't terrible but I just read it I didn't get wrapped up in the characters
A wonderfully touching book with honest emotions  I loved the characterswas crying several times throughout the story This book has made an impression on my heart
Compelling story line The characters were just a little less than believablebut I loved them even so  The story made the reader feel blessed to be alive and healthy
It's a beautiful tale not about cancer but a story about those living with it TFIOS really gets into your emotions and it's one of the best books you will ever read
This book is lovely and heart-wrenching at the same time The characters feel authentic and the story is moving It's hard to put the book down Read with a tissue box
Not only was this book beautifully tragic but also will keep you up all night reading You wont be able to put this book down Read the whole thing in only a few hours
This book gives a new meaning to true love and true tragedy It is bitterly honest in the endbut truly sweet in the journey  This book will open your eyes to reality
I wasn't sure what to expect when I started reading this book it is defiantly in my top 5 favorite books of all time It is defiantly a must read you won't regret it
I loved it Sad yes but lovely all at the same time Beautifully written I was nervous to read it as I am not one to read sad books but I'm so glad I read this one
This book captures emotions that I didn't know I had Everyone should read this book I cried and got upset But realized that's life This book is amazingly beautiful
The Fault In Our Stars is a great book that I highly recommend to anyone that loves a true love story and can get a little emotional too It's a must read kind of book
I so enjoyed the truthfully touching story that this book offers Great writing that pulls at your heartstrings and reminds you what's important in the beautiful world
Honestly one of the best books I've ever read It was moving hilarious and insightful I can't wait for the movie to come out ALL ages will enjoy this book (I'm 23)
I loved this book from beginning to end  I started to cry after everything goes downhill for Gus  If you choose to read this book keep tissues nearby for the ending
The Fault in Our Stars is a story of love  A story of triumph  I cannot fathom my thoughts on this book into constellations but I have some simple advice R-E-A-D I-T
This is a great book for teens/tweens I absolutely loved it extremely reccommendedPlease read I will be the best book u have ever read
I absolutely loved this book  John Green is a great writer and does an excellent job of making his characters very real  I would highly recommend this book to anyone
This story was different from what you see on the bookstore shelf currently It provided insight into a world most of us never truly understand The story is beautiful
This author writes about a sad topic but does it in a way that is humorous thoughtful and heartwarming  If you liked the Secret Life of Bees you will love this book
Snappy clever dialogue but hard to believe that it would come out of a teenager's mouth  Good quick read that despite the subject matter is not horribly depressing
This is a heart warming taken on a teenage love story I definitely recommend this book It's filled with quick witted humor This should be on every ones reading list
*No Spoilers*I preordered this book and went to John Green's signing so I was left with two copies of the book I'm so glad I was though because I have one to read over and over and one to circulate between my friends I really do love this book that muchFor me this book wasn't about dying and death Don't get me wrong there was a LOT of discussion about death but I felt that was more in relation to life itself And I loved the discussion about death as much as I loved Hazel talking about life--she wonders the same things that I do and makes the wondering itself less taboo I think Hazel is a beautiful character She has quirks and problems and things she likes and Hazel is consistent throughout the book even when everything around her is changingAll in all I thought this book was exciting beautiful and above all inspiring I believe it is a must-read for everyoneDFTBA
I finished reading The Fault in Our Stars a couple of days ago but the emotional resonance of the book is still strong John Green's Hazel tells us from the outset that she is dying but this book isn't about dying or even about cancer though several of the characters have cancer This book is about life and love I found myself reading some parts with a throat tight from the effort not to bawl out loud and then turning the page only to bark with laughterI feel about this book the way Hazel and Gus feel about An Imperial Affliction I almost don't want to tell people about it because it feels so intensely personally mine That's the thing about great literature though sharing it doesn't diminish your connection to itMaking it to the top of my favorite books list is not easy but this book rocketed there I want to read it again and again but I need to wait The emotions are still too raw right now
Having had a neuromuscular disorder all my life I did not grow up in the way most people do I'm not saying that my way of growing up was either good or bad simply that it was my way This fact-that our experiences are neither good nor bad bad but simply are (that they are good only in the sense that life is worth being lived)-was made fresh to me by The Fault in Our Stars I found this book to be witty gripping and downright brilliant Ill people it says with delightful sarcasm are not especially courageous and admirable for trying to live despite the obstacles they have to face It is in the nature of every living being to do this Early in the book Hazel sums up her own and everyone else's reason for being: I like being a person and I want to keep at it The fault in other words does not lie in the obstacles themselves but in the all-too-human failure to realise that surmounting obstacles is a natural part of life
I really like John Green's writing This is the first of his novels I have read but he is a co-author of Will Grayson Will Grayson and I thoroughly enjoyed it John Green's writing feels very realistic and is chocked full of fun references and quirky thoughts The characters in The Fault in Our Stars are all very real Most of the characters have cancer and the ways they deal with it are unique and interestingThis novel is definitely a sad cancer book but Green's writing connected me so well with the characters The novel without an ending within the book that connects the main characters really adds to the story The novelist in the Netherlands was one of my favorite characters There are so many thought provoking topics brought up in this bookI suggest this book to EVERYONE I will definitely be purchasing more of John Green's novels If you are not subscribed to Vlog Brothers on youtube do it NOW
An awesome book for any y age  My granddaughter was 13 years old when she read it and I am 62 years oldquite an age range  We both recommend this as a great read
out of 4 books in his box set this is the only book i didn't feel the urge to finish other three were great in varying degree but this one just didn't do it for me
It is a tear jerker and it reveals some things most humans aren't aware of It is different than other things I've read The excitement and plot is off the chain
Loved it loved it loved it so great wish there was an epilogue on Hazels ending Did she die sooner or did she go later What happened to Hazel but anyways loved lots
We have a family member with cancer and the emotions expressed in this bookare very familiar This book is well written and tells the cancer story like it really is
This is a touching love story I could not put down even though I had seen the movie and knew what was to come I had to keep turning pages to know what happens next
Got this for my daughter for a Christmas gift she told me to read it an I fell in love with this book Even had me teary eye off this one part Great book of 2014
Love the quote  The world is not a wish-granting factory The book is filled with poetic justice Makes you sit up and take notice and appreciate family and friends
Short Sweet Emotional Story Of Love And Finding Joy In When Life Is Most Difficult  I Was Sucked InCould Not Put The Book Down Until The Story Was Over  Thanks
I know this is meant for a younger audience but it was a good read although pretty sad and then the movie came out and i like that they stuck pretty close to the book
Touching Laughed and cried It really helps you to understand the pain and love of a person going through a terminal disease A book everyone should read Incredible
This book is inspiring  Although it is all about cancer  it is  uplifting not depressing  It reminds the reader  of what is important and matters and what  doesn't
wow  a tragic story told from an upbeat perspective Honest treatise on surviving adversity while realizing what is important in a life lived for 80 years or 80 days
I couldn't put it down  Hazel and Augustus revel in life not death as they face life's ultimate battle (death)  together  Head on they find the fault in our stars
Sure it had a few good parts in it Some even had my eyes wet (but not tearing)But overall I probably would've enjoyed it more if i was 5-10 years yonger

After I read this I cried for 2hours it's so romantic and I just realized that could get sick and die too but I wonder who will remember we me What Mark will I leave
This book caught me off my emotional guard  A treasure in the youth of life and maturity of death without an age in numbers John Green deserves the grand applause
A very engaging tale  of love and how precious every moment is  I fell in love with Augustus Waters and Hazel Grace and it was an honor and a privilege to know them
It's been ages since I've finished reading a book I spent my weekend doing just that I've never cried at any life event yet this book had me in tears A great read
This book is amazing Normally I don't go for cancer books but this book is now my favorite It's written beautifully and the characters are amazing I love this book
I love a book that makes you feel it all I felt the happiness I felt the hope I felt the grief This will be one of the few books that I will re-read over and over
perfectly written through the eyes of a teen struggling to live with a terminal diseaseit made me feel what my daughter felt going through her battle with cancer
A beautiful story honest and moving I would encourage anyone that has experienced loss of a loved one to read it and gain a perspective not often shared so honestly
Loved it A true version of pain and questions and what it means to be mortal A brilliant novel that any one with what is this life questions needs to read
I really love  this  bookI read it so fast it is really good please read it It is both an inspiration and a love story do yourself a favor and just read it
This book is sooo sad ( coming from an 11 year old girl) and very detailed I finished the book at school and was about ready to start crying like REALLY hard:(
Amazing book  Sad book  An amazingly sad book Never knew a man that makes crash course world history videos onYouTube could be such an amazing author  Okay Okay
This is not a tender feel good touchy feely book but its not meant to be This book will break your heart with its honesty but will also feed your soul Be prepared
I loved this book as a whole but the characters are supposed to be teenagers They talk as if they're college professors They all have similar personalities as well
This is a beautiful story for any age I understand why my 7th grade students love it but it is lesson on the beauty of life and love that resonates with adults too
This is my first review as I don't normally bother I had to with this book though  It  was phenomenal Sad Definitely But the lessons learned are worth the read
Very touching story  Makes you appreciate every day you have  Cancer is a terrible thing and teenagers &amp; children do get it  This story was insightful to teenagers
I absolutely love this book it is sad heart warming adorable and full of love I couldn't have read a better book I am excited to go watch the movie in June &lt;3 &lt;3
I have never had to relate to such struggles  How touching and eye opening  Loved this book  If you haven't read this I recommend you take some time to enjoy this
Well written and engaging The characters are developed in a way that makes you really embrace them Great story of finding love in the midst of illness and challenge
A must read  Very well written inspiring  What more can I say-we will all be in this circumstance love and loss and leaving whispers of immortality  Just read it
I chose this rating because this book is real It really bases on real people with real lives with cancer I would recommend this book to anyone in 7th grade and up
This is a deliciously written work of art  For a brief time it satisfied my chocolate cravings  I was sad to be finished with the book and will miss the characters
Easy to read and I liked the point of view of young teenagers telling their story Parents as well as those of us in the healthcare profession can relate on some level
so endearing and funny and heart breaking and real and sad This would have received a higher rating if there had been some eternal hope and morality There wasn't
My kindle is basically forcing me to write a review Review review review great okay done I would do an actual review except I HAVEN'T FINISHED THE FREAKING BOOK GAH
The fault in our stars is a good book because the characters are normal people with a normal human issue so u can really put yourself in their place Read itüòÄ
this story was just great it was sad yet great it was sweet but honest it didn't paint this like great picture of dying it basically just said it sucks five stars
this book was a love story where both main characters were in store for a bittersweet ending honest heart-warming and beautifully composed: I couldn't ask for more
This heart wrenching book is a must read books for young adults John Green steals your emotions and makes them go on a roller coaster the entire time Simply amazing
I have not been able to read a book all the way through in one sitting for the longest time but this book captivated me it made me laugh and cry it was just amazing
I have been reading nonstop medical material and journal for college I took a break and wanted something real where I can laugh cry and get pissed This was the book
This book was amazing Great love story and a great story about death Would recommend to everyone especially those who are fighting cancer or have a loved one who is
I have no way to adequately describe how I feel about this bookIt was like looking at something so beautiful you could not tear your eyes away Thank you John Green
I do not know what else to say about this book but it is a great story I loved this book it was well written great character development and emotional heart tugger
This book was an instant favorite of mine I love everything John Green does He is easily become my favorite author I am excited for the movie to come out next year
This book does a wonderful job of putting you in the lives of its characters Makes you really look at life an a variety of different ways Just an overall great book
I got so caught up in the love story I almost forgot about the cancer but like cancer does it came right back to bite you It will make you laugh cry and then some
A sad but somewhat inspiring story of love and making most of a short amount of time This is a realistic portrayal of some emotional moments among friends and family
This was a pleasant surprise Had I known what the subject of this story was before hand I would not have read it BUT- I am glad I did The characters are great
reasons why this book sucks:really bad charactersromanticized illnessMe: Too much of Thisliterally why did he think this was a good idea
This is a awesome book I am not much of a reader but this kept me reading and before I realized it I was done with the book I will be downloading more on my kindle
Even though I was so moved and saddened by the story I had to keep reading It took me months to finish because I just needed to put it down  Well written touching
I like this because it doesn't just drop off at the end it sums it up and actually ends the book On a 1-10 1 being the worst 10 being the best I would rate it at a 7
Such an amazing book it was just like the movie but certain parts went into more details than the movie did I think I cried more in the book than I did in the movie
I heard all the hype on this book and debated for a while getting it and I finally did so All I can say is this book is just beautiful and a rollercoaster of a ride
So sad  I hated it because it was so sad  As a mother the plot is a nightmare but so beautifully written and engaging that I couldn't put the book down  I cried :(
I liked the funny dialogue Augustus and Hazel and delightful characters Not a big fan of stories about kids dying but everyone and their sister was recommending it
5 stars totally I loved this book It was a cute little romantic with two people that have a touch of cancerI loved the whole thing I didn't dislike anything
Beautifully written sparing no one who has ever felt completely lost in love Great story line and well developed characters that you can truly care about Loved it
Such a humble and sobering book  Being a cancer patient  I can relate to so much that this book is about  I loved reading it and will read it again over and over
I really enjoyed reading this book Very witty and enlightening story about love and the battle to survive Now I need to see the movie You will not be disappointed
It was astonishing how high the grammatical level was in this book I know a numerous amount of people didn't comprehend all the vocabulary It was beautiful and sad
This book is told very well It is not ignoring the subject but the author did not make it a cancer book He wrote a love story that is a truly beautiful work of art
It really gives you a life lesson I really enjoyed this heartbreaking book One thing I disliked was when he killed him I literally cried Loved this book though
I loved this book  So very sad  I've lost family to cancer  Its a terrible disease especially when it affects  kids  Thank you to the families for sharing your story
This book was a page turner for sure For me it doesn't happen very often that a book keeps calling to me to keep reading I would highly recommend this book to read
I gave The Fault In Our Stars five starsI loved How Agustus Waters was so funny and loving until the very end and I suggest this book to anyone at all
I expected more from this book because everyone raved about it I found it predictable and typical of our society's obsession with Nicholas Sparks stories
There was nothing I liked about this book I thought it made fun of a very serious topic and  I saw very little humor in any of it Sorry I wasted my time reading it
I have just lost someone to cancer so this book was incredibly difficult to read but it hooks you in I definitely suggest reading this book You won't regret it
This book was another one of those books that I just could not put I loved this book because not only was I reading the emotions going on but I was feeling them too
Wasn't sure if I could read this knowing some of the subject matter would bring me to tears but I can not put it down  And I can't wait to see the movie  Love it
I loved it  Such an easy read with an unexpected ending  I still have some questions that have been left unanswered just as the characters in the book did  Ironic
By far not what I expected Fell in love with both Hazel and Gus and their love for each other as well as their understanding that life isn't always what we wish for
A beautifully written book that should be read by young and old alike  The characters will stay with you long after you read the last page  Wonderful job Mr Green
Excellent writing Interesting outlook on the disease  Wonderful descriptions of all the character and good development As a cancer patient I found it very moving
Really enjoyed this book It kind of hit close to home My dad was illnot from cancer but he did succumb to his illnesses and this book really helped me feel again
I read the sample and although it is not the type of book I usually read I found I had to continue and read thr entire book Very sad ending Have your Kleenex handy
Wow I have grown with reading this book It ends to soon It end and we are still wondering about mom and the flower guy But it ends knowing her mom and dad are ok
I don't read often but when I do I choose a book that I hear more than once about from my peersI read this in one day because I could not stop turning the pages
It started out as an ordinary book and then grabbed a hold of me and took me on an emotional roller coaster ride  I don't know when it happened but I am glad it did
A sad read but fresh and sprinkled with clever prose(Why do so many young people get cancer  Let's concentrate on the causes more than just the cures)
Great book We should all live like Hazel and Gus Sweet and sad but reflective of what living and dying of cancer must be like for the patient and family True love
This book did a good job of showing the ripple effect of cancer on the people that have it and on the people left behind Felt sadness for lives interrupted so young
Before I started reading this book I honestly did not expect that much of it I loved it since the beginning it is a great great love story suitable for all ages
I usually don't read books like this but heard such wonderful news about it I took a chance  I totally enjoyed it from beginning to end  Highly recommend this book
You go in thinking it's going to be sad but as reading it it is actually very well put together and makes you laugh the two main characters have great personalities 
Beautifly written Cried through 60% of the book Going through a very difficult break up and this book took me to another world where true unconditional love exists
Thoroughly enjoyed this book Very sad in parts but touching and happy too A book that I will share with friends and read again myself Cannot wait to see the movie
very interesting book  once i started reading this storyit was hard to put the book down  it was easy to get intothe characters and feel their emotions
very good read however felt it written for a younger age group- 14-20  It will make for good discussion with my 15 year old granddaughter who recently saw the movie
I loved this book I laughed then cried and laughed and cried even harder Wonderfully written Could not put it down once I started I hope the movie does it justice
I think this should be a must read for kids and parents of kids with serious medical issues  I've known a couple of friends that could have used this book years ago
its an amazing book filled with happiness and sorrow but thats life this a romance story of two young kids who grom to love each other and i loved every second of it
An emotional read with plenty of opportunity to empty your tear ducts repeatedly A very realistic view of dealing with cancer that makes me despise Peter van houten
This is an amazing YA novel The kids are actually intelligent An honest look at living with and dying from disease Thank you Mr Green for this gift of literature
this book is very contagious once you start reading you can not stop it's filled with romance comedy and even suspense that will keep the book glued to your hand
I absolutely loved this book  I liked the concept of a different view on cancer  I also learned a little about what it was like to live with cancer which was cool
Amazing And gut wrenching Also gave me new perspectives So many mixed emotions that made hold my partner and son a whole lot tighter Lord knows I love my mother
This  book was perfect Beautiful yet tragic Really shows the reality in life&lt;3 I cried for 70 pages It only took me 10 hours to read it  I couldn't put  it down
Words cannot describe how much I enjoyed thisüòçit's truly amazing They movie was amazing as well I half to say  Augusts waters is the man every girl dreams ofüåüüíôüí≠
This book resounded within me There are no words for the thoughts and feelings it has caused me to feel I'm rarely speechless but I am now after reading this book
This book was amazingg It told a story that was real and wasn't just a typical love story It will grab your attention and show you what courage and love really is
What is so great about this book is you know reading it will hurt but you keep going anyway similarly to the way Hazel and Augustus fall in love Beautiful story
This book puts life in perspective Life is short but good Hazel is a very identifiable character and her perspective on cancer and life is so realistic and honest
A must read for everyone  Great from start to finish read it in 2 days  Very well written and I will read other books by John Green  Will definitely see the movie
This book literally had me in tears The message behind this book is great I would definitely recommend thus book Although it is sad it is totally worth the tears
I got hit with the flu and decided to read it  Not a story just for teens  This almost middle aged mother of four read the whole thing in an afternoon  Good stuff
I love this book it so good I corny stop readingI would recommend it to age 10+I chose this rating bc this book was a really awesome book I loved it
This was one of the most amazing books I have read in a long time It got me caught from the paragraph So I recommend everybody to read this absolutely amazing book
This book was amazing and I laughed out loud and cried like a baby but that is how I know it was amazing One of the best books I have ever read Nice job john green
Loved everything about this book Witty writing tragically lovable characters If you want to fall in love and maybe even have your heartbroken then read this book
Great book Once I started reading couldn't stopLoved the way the story went untill Gus died Wasn't sure how that was going to play out but in the end I understood
this book I see more teenagers a d young adults reading it gives the true view on a young girl suffering from the side effects of death I enjoyed this hopeful story
I usually don't fangirl over anything but this book was one I absolutely loved I honestly don't see how anyone could rate it lower than a five It's just fantastic
I tried to read this book awhile ago &amp; couldn't finish I'm so glad I tried again I cried as I read it It was an incredible book And I can't wait to see the movie
I fell in love with this book in the first twenty pages It made me crave a love like Augustus and Hazel's Best book I've read in a long time Could not put it down
I have never cried at a book ever in my life I have also never cried so hard if u should ever read this books be prepared for a sweet romantic heart wrenching story:(
Heartbreaking and beautiful I couldn't put it down For a book about sick kids it wasn't hard to read and it gave a clear picture of the individuals not the sickness
I thought this book was okay I had heard amazing comments about it but it wasn't the greatest ever I have read better books It swears a LOT I wouldn't recommend it
Wow I had read all the reviews and it still exceeded my expectations Not an easy topic and yes you need tissues but a wonderful book that I would highly recommend
so deep and real reading this book I could feel all emotionsas if me the reader could suffer their paintheir love it was an amazing book so brilliantly written
I cried so much and went numb with pain But in the end everything was so peaceful like how dew drops are resting on lucious green grass  It was very well written
This book was amazing The vivid writing and descriptions took me to Indiana to Amsterdam and back This love story put me Literally in the heart of Jesus
I laughed I cried I used my dictionary because these teen kids had a better vocabulary than I do Wish more people were as well-spoken and introspective as these
This book has been the best book I have ever read I live the romance and love between Gus and hasel I would recommend this book to teen girls and young adult women
I don't read a lot and this book changed me I look forward to reading now You'll laugh cry be angry and be happy This book is a rollercoaster Highly reccomend
Is there anything else to say(Apparently yes because Amazon has a word minimum)((Augustus would love/hate this stupidity))okay
This book is the perfect blend of humourromance and loss I would recommend it to anyone but particularly those who can appreciate humour in serious situations
An amazing young love story that will actually make you appreciate life and the simplest things even more Just to find love in your life is the most important thing
It was an amazing thought-provoking book Albeit sad i truly enjoyed reading this story because of the wonderful characters and the way it made you appreciate life
So good I can't describe it and want to know what happens to Hazel Grace just like she wanted to know what happened to the other characters in An Imperial Affliction
Beautiful Absolutely beautiful Brings tears to my eyes thinking about it Amazing book Must read Beautiful love story Makes you appreciate what you have in life
This book was deep funny happy intelligent and sad all mixed together A very good read sure to make  your heart jump  and ache as you fall in love and also die
This book was so romantic and full of true love This book is an inspiration to me I love how the author used the fault in our stars as one of the quotes he created
I don't really have the words to express how much I loved this book  The humor the vulnerability the love the truth the pain of life when encompassed by cancer o
I think I cried from chapter 15 on Heart warming story Teaches the valuable lesson of not talking life for granted Definitely recommend Very fast read LOVEEEEEEE
This was an interesting  read even though very sad  It's a book that is difficult to put down because you want to know the end even though you dread it A good book
The most amazing book ever  I loved this book  very  touching and sad  I hope there's another  Can't wait to see a movie about it or at least another book 
A book I couldn't put down I shared the lives with these characters and ached to belong in their circle  The courage of these side effects was captured perfectly
Fantastic book but the ending caught me  off guard I wished the author finished with a little more closure but otherwise I loved it ad it was a tear jerker for sure
I cried That is all
I must admit that I have never written a review on a book Out of all that I have readnone captured my heart and attention quite like this one I've never been so captivated in the storyline or so emotionally invested in the characters that I actually shed tears when they are no longer a being of fictional proportion I am 16 just like Hazel I feel as though I can identify with the feeling of being in love But yet I am not near as strong which I presume is a word she would scoff at thinking it cliche I do not know the struggles of cancerbut I feel as though unless by God's will that I develop a cancer of my own this is as close as I can possibly be to feeling the pain and having a hamartia such as those of Hazel and Augustus I have been taught through a new outlook that everyday is preciousand you can't change your circumstances all the time but you can change your response to them
It's just too sad if a story It made me depressedI wish there was more interaction instead of her inner dialog
Such an emotional ride Had me in tears all the way through Some were sad and some were from joy  Book has you sucked into the world of the characters from page 1
Wonderful story filled with delight tenderness courage discovery Authentic bitter sweet and expands the heart and mind I wish I could write stories like this
Having been a person who has grieved a decade over lost love I didn't think I could think any new thoughts about life love and the abyss that is grief I was wrong
Such a great book I enjoyed it and the movie did not live up to the book They left out some great parts that were my favorite in the book but overall great combo
At times I found The Fault in our Stars hard to follow but that being said I couldn't put it downIt made me think a lot and it will make you think Enjoy
If you've seen the movie go ahead and read the book It's just as good as the movie and they even stayed fairly close to the story line There will be tears though
Nothing earth shattering nothing shocking nothing unexpectedbut a simple and lovely story of friends and family and the fear and dread and reality of mortality
I would recommend this book to all my friends It has a mature theme that makes everyone seem like smart cheesy romantic people There is nothing that I didn't like
Star crossed lovers meets disease but in a very moving way Was a great read made me feel sad happy mad and excited at different points in the story very real
I think this book was amazing it's so true and it's seems so real I felt the happiness of Hazel's first kids and the sadness of Gus's death This is my favorite book
This book was amazing It made me cry because of how sad it was sometimes I really liked it It is my favorite book of all time You should definitely get it
I chose this rating because it expressed feelings and hazel I love her she relates to me so much I want the author to write another fault in our stars book please
I enjoyed reading this book Lot of lessons learnt and lot of things to thinkabout life Just be grateful for what we have I would recommend this book to everyone
This book was beyond wonderful Im not a sucker for love stories but let me say this book touched my heart It was defiantly a great book It is highly recommended
This was an awesome read Not the type of novel I would normally pick but I loved it Funny charming intelligent heartwarming heartbreaking and sad all in one
Great Very well written and sentamental:This told a great story about the lives of Hazel Grace and Augustus Waters coming together into a inspiring conclusion
This was definitely not my kind of read  but purchased it because of all of the popularity about it  I believe it is targeted to a much younger generation than me
Glad this book had a Kindle version It proved convenient and readily available when I had a quick moment to read it and therefore finished within a week Great read
This is by far my favorite of the John green books Brilliantly written with lots of Ups and downs on the fantastic journey through learning what it is to be in love
A beautiful touching story of teenagers in love despite their respective cancer diagnoses Makes one realize just how important it is to live in the present moment
Great book If you are not a reader you have to listen to this audio book  Kate Rudd does an amazing job reading Enjoyed the interview with John Green at the end
A very well written story of life and love It's really a beautiful love story how to really be one with the universe and appreciate it even with hard circumstances
Augustus and Hazel are now my two favorite people They had me laughing crying debating and loving I reD this whole book in 6 hours and am left wanting more
The book was amazing without any doubt It's heart-breaking and beautifulI however would not recommend the movie as strongly as I would recommend the book
Would I read this again  Probably not  But there are some books out there that leave their mark on you the first time you read themand sometimes that's enough
I was told this was a great book by a friend and she was right I loved it until the endand was sad when I read the last word Awesome book I highly recommend it
It was  Great teenage romance an  it was  also a quick read I wanted to read the book before actually seeing the movie now I hope the book is a  good as the movie
This book made me laugh and cry I felt what the characters were feeling It's a great read just prepare for the tears they will come Can't wait to see the movie
Have tissue handy when you read this book You can feel the characters and how they respond to life It's funny as well and makes you think of life and it is to you
This love story made me laugh and cry sometimes at the same time Loved the characters and the twists and turns A real page turner that left me smiling at the end
As a middle school teacher I was searching for something to help my students feel some type of true emotion This book succeeds at doing that Thanks for writing it
This book was amazing I completed reading it a little over 48 hours after purchasing it; I couldn't put it down It's a unique romance and drama without cheesiness
This book was really an insightful look at how young adults cope with the stuggles of Cancer It dealt with the topic of family friends and everyday life and death
I bought this book less than 24 hours ago and I have already finished it It was the kind of book where you just can't put it down Looks like I'll be re-reading it
I thought that the characters particularly Augustus were under-developed  I didn't feel a strong attachment to any of the characters not even the narrator Hazel
An amazing story that reels you in and doesn't let go This is one of those books that one searches and longs for to remove them from one's own reality A must read
I loved it  Warning tho it's sad and almost depressing A BEAUTIFUL LOVE STORY BETWEEN TWO TEENS WITH CANCER Go read it I promise you won't regret it:) okay
Great book easy to read and unpredictable at times Haven't found a book I couldn't put down in a long time but I sacrificed sleep for this one Highly recommend
20000000 stars if I could this Book opens your eyes and tells you what the world really is the characters in this book are different well you will see read this now
This is the best book I have ever read I simply can't put it down It's the perfect story Also thanks john green for creating unrealistic expectations for any man
Heartfelt love that shared in common a killing disease but through thick and thin the love never ended This book showed the surprises and unexpected events of life
This book is full of feels I don't know what to really say besides this book is so amazingly touching I can't express is vast importance in one miniscule review
My high school students recommended this book to me I could not put it down It is a great story that will enlighten you with another perspective of life and death
This was a great read You learn a lot about people who have a bigger struggle in life than you and this book helps you love again what you have taken advantage of
I don't like to  characterized a book but I feel this book is geared for young women it took me about 60 percent into the book to get going felt it ended to abruptly
This book It's a damn good book That's all I can really say Read it first movies are never as good and no movie will come close to being as amazing as this book
I will admit I just wanted to read this book because of the movie coming out I am so glad that I did I am in love with this book I laughed and bawled like a baby
OMG this novel will change your life Its a touching love story about to cancer survivors this book will make u cry it will make u laugh and it will make u think
Loved this book Wish I had read it as a teenager Very inspiring - reminded me of My Sister's Keeper by Jodi Piccoult Finished this book within 24 hours
The Fault in Our Stars was by far my absolute favorite book John Green made me fall in love with Augustus Waters and left me wishing Hazel Grace was part of life
Okay(Ps this book is perfect for anyone Young old retired widowed divorced grenade-like EVERYONE I hope you enjoy it as much as I did DFTBA)
This book was amazing It takes on a whole different perspective of the greatest tragic love story of the 21st century  My only complaint is the foul language
I could not put this book down I think the author did a great job defining the characters in this book and showing their raw emotions I highly recommend this text
It was an awesome read I read it with my daughter and it facilitated a true bonding experience It was extremely convenient to loan electronic copy from my library
This was a good book about romance and cancer I would recomend it for teens Tweens and everyone in there twenties or maybe a little older Can't wait for the movie
Incredible story Literally if I try to write about it I will start crying I will also not spoil it for anyone I'll just say that I love this book augustus I do
Best book I've ever readI cried like a baby when it was over So many inspirational things said and done; this book makes me look at life differently than before
Omg my favorite book I am crying so hard now that I'm done and even though I'm only 12 I don't care about all the inapropreitte things in it  I LOVE THIS BOOK
This is a must read You cannot read this without learning something about life And death And relationships Amusing yet also very sad it's difficult to put down
Omg I am crying rich  know I can't believe how good this book is no this book is great I wish every book was like this one  Love  Your favorite fan Gabi
I laughed and cried while cherishing the minutes  This book will make you think about how you live life  The characters are real and the story keeps you reading
I have never been so emotionally attached to a book as this one  I laughed and cried as the characters did  It was probably one of the best books I have ever read
I just loved it  Amazing portrayal of adolescent friendship love fear death survival and how acceptance is paramount in all our lives as children parents etc
I found this to feel so true I often smiled through my tears It seems to me young people get it all  Why do we forget to see it clearlyThis warmed heart so
Clever Quick witted Surprising Leaves you longing for more Yet- You are better off leaving exactly where it Endswith a heavy heart Hug your loved ones today
The fault in our stars is an emotional story from start to finish Hazel grace isn't your usual cancer patient and when she meets Augustus waters things get better
This book is full of happiness and sadness but it tells such a beautiful story From the beggining one can easily guess how it will end but either way it is great
This book gives its reader a look a life in a perspective that most people don't look at it with It s an amazing book and I would definitely recommend it to anyone
Told by a teenager who has been living with cancer; the author is witty and cleaver I found myself laughing and crying throughout the read I very much enjoyed it
one of the best and saddest books I have ever read I have read this book three times and every single time I want more it is absolutely hands-down incredible
This book is wonderful It's so eye opening and indescribable It has also made me realise how important the little things are in life I'd recommend this to anyone
Such a simple sweet book Very well written Really touches your heart The tears came flowing all through this book not like they have in any other book I've read
The Fault in Our Stars is EASILY the best book I have ever read I couldn't put it down I plan on rereading it many times like Hazel reread An Imperial Affliction&lt;3
I don't have much to say except don't read this unless you want to do like a child It was amazing and beautiful but it's one of those stories I can only read once
Beautiful Don't miss out on reading this book before it's a film You'll fall in love with the characters- even the ones you should hate It's a very powerful book
This was a nice quick read and a very well written and adorable story but not the happiest book ever that much you can figure out in one page Worth a read though
I thought this book was very well narrated and I was definitely rooting for the main characters  I found some of it highly unrealistic but enjoyed it all the same
This was hard to read for me as i have recently lost the father of my two sons to cancer  It really saddened me to read this hopeless perspective on life and terminal illness This isn't the end There is more to this life than living and dying There is HOPE and it is found in Jesus Christ There is life after death in Heaven for an eternity Cancer touches us all Me and my boys know their dad is healed in Heaven and i wish this author and these characters would've known the joy u can have through earthly pain and suffering because u know your eternity will b perfect and without suffering This is a sad account of how too many people who dont know Christ view life and death  It is very well written but it saddened me to read this perspective when I know there is so much more to this life I pray the author finds someone who will share the truth with him so he can write another book with an eternal perspective
The fault in our stars reminds me why I love books in the first place Books are in my opinion an underestimated medium of communication theses days John continually reminds us through his youtube videos and his novels that books were created to pass information on from person to person Weather you are reading The Fault in Our Stars a Shakespearian play or your physics text book you are ultimately reading a message that someone somewhere thought was important enough to write down And to all of you who are skeptical about reading a soppy cancer book I say to you yes this book will probably make you cry but read it anyway While this books is about two teenagers who are sick and do things like play video games and vandalize people's property it is also about human consciousness our purpose in life and honest young innocent love So to all the nerdfighters out there read this book DFTBA and best wishes :)
I really enjoyed this book  It is a hard subject kids with cancer  It was well written  Bittersweet  Of course there is sorrow but there is also so much hope
I chose 5 stars because you never get to have that love and when you do you can't get it back I recommend this book Sure it'll make you cry but it's worth it
Well written and engaging  Given the subject there are surprisingly few tear-jerking moments and surprisingly many LOL moments  I'm really glad I read this book
I gave this book a five star rating because it is full of twists and turns and is the best book I have ever read  and probably will ever read# awesomeness
Fantastically sad and thought provoking Absolutely loved it Characters are the best part Recommend everyone except maybe if you recently lost a child to cancer
book was okay but half the time I couln't understand what the characters were talking about they seemed fake and unrealistic teenagers to me just my opinion
A friend told me about this book It is amazing I recommend it to anyone who likes to read as much as I do The ending kind of leaves you hanging but a great book
A beautiful young love story with the health challenges that open your mind and learn about those that live through such challenges Surprising sad and enchanting
this was an amazing book I absolutely loved it I definitely recommend this book to anyone It is a well rounded book a little bit of everything drama action etc
This book kept me going  I love it  It made me smile laugh and of course it made me cry  All I know is life is way too damn short  So love with all you have
I hesitated to read this book because I'm not a young person anymore but glad I got over that silliness  John is a great writer and more people need to read this
This was a good book I wish they would have had a better trip going to meet the author of that book that was a let down Great book for teenagers and young adults
I love this a book it's so touching I'm in love with this book all though it's more humorous than the movie it was just a wonderful experience reading this book
This book is the best book ever written I love it so much even though it was so sad it made me cry and I never cry So thanks fir making such an AWESOME book
Lovely I fell in love reading this even though I had to catch my breath a few times as I choked back the tearsI hated that it ended but it ended well
This book was an easy read I think it could've been better but I enjoyed it I had a lack of an emotional connection to the story which took away from it for me
I love this book I am glad that it's not ruined with a second book like some books are Thank you for writing this I love it :DEven though it made me cry
This is one one the best books I've ever read It  is sweet and sad all at the same time It's so hard to put down It teaches many life lessons I LOVE this book
This is one of those rare books where you find yourself actually taking your time with it and purposefully stalling the finish because you don't want it to be over
This book was amazing I loved it it made me so sad I cried hazel sounds amazing she and Augustus were perfect I want  to know what happens to hazel though thank you
A love story like no other After seeing interviews with the actors from the movie I felt this was a story we all need to readKeep a tissue handy and enjoy
I Enjoyed both the book and the movie for the most part they did a great job with the movie but of coarse the book was more detailed with feelings and emotional 
That is all Love üíõ it is the best work written on the topic of suffering through terminal illness and heartbreak-which I believe are far too similar to separate
I liked the plot of the story for the most part Interesting read I would recommend it to someone who has experienced the loss of a loved one to illness as I did
I was nervous about reading this because I thought it might be too heavy and while it does deal with a heavy subject it is a great story  Glad I read it
I want to stop crying but I can't  it is so sad that Gus died when he should have lived and I just want to stop crying so much but I can't But it was a very good 
I loved this book It made me laugh it made me cry but most of all I admired the bravery of those young people and all who are fighting the fight on a daily basis
I FOUND this book very inspiring You find that most people feel sorry for themselves This book shows people too live with there emotions rather then against them
The book has great thoughts and feelings A good read after a long time I think the book is very close to Love Story by Segal The pain is different but it's real
I was so so infatuated by this book It is one of the few books that I could read co instantly over and over and never lose interest in John Green is incredible
I wanted to read this before watching the movie so I read it on a flight recently I cried after this one INCREDIBLY SAD ENDING Don't read with out CleanEx handy
A beautiful book with writing that will ensnare you A beautiful and tragic story of true love and true lost Definitely one of my favorite books I've ever read
I loved this book It made me laugh but it also made me cry It was a beautiful tale about romance and love What John green wrote in this book is completely true
I decided to purchase the book before seeing the movie and now I cannot wait to go and see the movie Very touching and keep list of kleenexes handy while you read
Very simply a real story Plausible in it's history conscionable in it's emotions touching in it's philosophy and warmth at the behest of frigidity A good read
The characters were well defined The story moved forward at a fast pace Although the main characters were dealing with imminent death the story was not a sad one
I love this book at first I was expecting a romantic novel but for me it also contains words with a deep meaning behind them and you can learn more about yourself
this is by far my favorite book that i have read i just went to go see the movie and it was great too I recommend reading the book before you see the movie though
This book has made me realize that this life is temporary and can end any moment A great read and truly inspiring It is an epic love story that you will enjoy
You have to read the book before you go see the movie because some of the things in the book make much more since then in the movie but the book in general is grand
Amazing book that teaches you to live and understand that death comes to us all Some sooner than other A love story that had me laughing and crying like a baby
This book encompasses so many different real emotions that we all go though everyday I have re read this book on numerous occasions and it gets better every time
I think it was amazing how she always said  she was a grenade and at one point she would explode and hurt anyone in her pathBut in the end Gus was the grenade
I just could not put this book down Both Hazel and Augustus took my breath away This is one of the best books I have ever  read and hope you read and enjoy it to
This is the kind of book that gives you a different perspective on death and a better appreciation of life and just the little things Good book to read in your 20s
Very good for young readers  I liked the humorous way the very serious issues were handled  You got to see how the parents felt as well as how the teenagers felt
this was one of the best books of have ever read it it's amazing and just a phenomenon in itself I will keep rereading this forever because it means so much to me
This book is amazing from the beginning to the end This book was touching in so many ways while made me laugh and smile at times I am so excited to see the movie
deeply emotional and truthful journey I really felt like I was experiencing the story with the main characters each character was rich and poignant in their role
I love this book with a passion I feel like the fact that it takes metaphors and creates them into  reality is just breathtaking I hope that this book has a sequel
Sad yet humorous I recommend this book to everyoneLiving in Indiana I could picture these characters as someone I have seen or met A truly humbling book
this book was very inspiring  I loved it  I finished it in 2 days I still have so many questions but I loved it and would read it over and over as long as I live
The characters were very well created I just wish the story panned out a little more The story although tragic is a bit uplifting in many ways Would recommend
Good book  Sad but makes you think wonderfully written Would have liked to hear more out of their author friend Can't wait to see if the movie does it justice
The absolute most beautiful book I have ever read This books show you don't have to be healthy to have love you just have to have LOVE to feel LOVE Best book ever
This is so beautifully written I applaud you John Greenthank you for giving the world this masterpieceSigned respectfullyYour new fan
I loved the perspective of this story The characters came to life for me Beautifully written story about first love  and the love of family and friends
The book was amazing I couldn't put it down There was nothing that I didn't love except that it had to endThank you John Green for writing such a wonderful book
Very original main characters Nice to see intelligent teenagers for a change Could have been a little longer but I guess it's length was good for the YA audience
I thought that this book was a very emotional book but it was also an eye opener because it makes you want to treasure your life and You are so lucky to have A life
A good read certainly Given the dialogue between characters it was difficult to believe they were teenagers With that said I would definitely recommend reading
The Fault In Our Stars was a great book The characters are compelling and the content is not overwhelming I hope the movie will live up to a fraction of the book
This book makes you rethink life I rarely read books but this time I'm glad I did It's amazing and makes me want someone just like Augustus Thank you John Green
Amazing book incredible writing beautiful story I couldn't put it down until I finished it I would and have been recommending this book to everyone that I know
Speechless this book left me speechless Words cant describe my feelings for this book It is absolutely breath taking John Green did an absolutely amazing job
I have never read a book all the way through for my own pleasure I am not a fan of reading but John Green Books are an exception Excellent book excellent author
This was a great book  I definitely needed a box of tissues while I was reading  Some of the language was difficult to understand and I had to reread a few times
well written beautiful book I am writing more because there is a requirement that needs more words but this is by far a book worth reading what more do you need
This book was so well written and deep it kept my attention the whole time I was reading it This truly shows what life really is when you know your close to death
Take the time to read this book  and while it may not be based on real facts There are young people fighting cancer every day and this could easily be their story
An amazing novel of love hope and living life to the fullestI would read it again defiantlyRecommended for teenagers who love the cute love stories
Great read It gave me a real insight to how people with cancer or other long illnesses view the world around them I did not want to put it down until it was done
The story of the two teenagers in this novel was gripping funny sweet and heartbreaking I couldn't put it down and was actually very sad to reach the end of it
Wow I laughed and cried It is witty and charming as well as sad I didn't want to put it down cause I wanted to know what was going to happen I read it in a day
What an excellent way to spend an afternoon It is beautiful and honest and heartbreaking One of those books you spend sobbing half of the time you are reading it
there is nothing profound that I can say to glorify a story of love won then lost but if I could say something it's that I'm on a roller coaster that only goes up
could not put this down I was truly captivated from page one and it felt as though a dear friend was sharing their story it is beautifully written and insightful
The book was just amazing if you love sad love storiesthis is just for you You will get some real good laughs and shed some tears I didn't want the book to end
Absolutely incredible could not put it down A must read for anybody It's a love story and heartbreak all in one with a fabulous message on the outlook of life
There is only one simple choice you have: read this book or not And the obvious answer is read The Fault in Our Stars Stop reading reviews and just read the book
A good read probably more for mid or high school  Interesting insight into the world of teenage cancer and the terrible reality of losing a child to this disease
I enjoyed this book because it was so different from what I traditionally read ie mysteries It was the most delicately woven live story that left me wanting more
So sad so emotional and yet you feel that it changes the way you feel about so many things in your lifeI will reread this book many times  Thank you Mr Green
Such a beautifully tragic love story I'm not going to review with an entire synopsis of the book because I could not do it justice Seriously purchase this book
Experienced every emotion that I could possibly want in a book Green truly mastered the art of storytelling from a side I have never experience prior to this read
Possibly the best book I have ever read Just amazing and was very hard to stop reading I could read this over and over I also can't wait until the movie in June
i freekin love this book soo much and i am so glad that i bought it it was sad in in some parts but you learn to get over it this is my number one recomendation
I really enjoyed this book  I highlighted many parts that were very thoughtfully written  It is about teens with cancer so it was a tough read for me as a parent
Overall amazing and heartbreaking or heartwrenching if you willSorry I'm trying to be like Hazel hahaBut I loved it and its a must-read
I enjoyed this book for the concept and modernousness if that even makes sense it was sad but teaches a good lesson overall the best book I have read in a long time
I'd never really thought about the world in the light that hazel saw it until i read this book Thanks for letting me know it's ok to leave love as my only mark :)
I think that that John Green may have tried to write a book that was different than the typical tragic book with main characters dying of cancer but if that was his goal he was not successful with the The Fault in Our Stars The protagonists in this book sixteen-year old Hazel and seventeen-year old Augustus meet at a support group for cancer patients and their love story evolves from there These two are wise beyond their years due to their circumstances with clever quirky conversation peppered with vocabulary and thoughts worthy of twenty-eight year olds They end up sounding very much like the Encouragements that Augustus' mother has throughout the house the ones that they see as trite and simplistic There is Death in the end but of course there are Lessons Learned and Life Goes On Perhaps because cancer disease and death are such painful and personal experiences this book just came off as dishonest manipulative and gimmicky
I was prepared to cry - but laughed through most of the book  I hope when my time comes I can face it with as much courage and grace as the kids in this book did
Wonderful book wonderfully written Not a very hard read but used dialogue appropriate for adult readers Stirring story that leaves you with plenty of emotions
This book is to good for words If I wasn't such a steel hearted person I might have cried  Seriously this book is brutally honest but also pleasurably sweet
Honestly the book is not written very well in terms of grammer syntax and verbiage It is an easy read The story line is engaging although slightly predictable
Would not have picked up a book about a teenager with terminal cancer but the public library's software pushed me towards it Could not put it down once I started
Awesome book very emotional the ending was not that pleasant but hazel chose to move on and still kept him in mind and all the memorise they spend together
Amazing story I laughed cried got mad and was happy READ THE BOOK BEFORE SEEING THE MOVIE (in any case but especially for TFIOS) John Green is a mastermind
Delightful read despite illness of characters  Movie was a disappointment especially after reading the book  John Green gave us these sweet characters  Thanks
One of the things I love about this book is that it shows that everyone is not perfect that people can break down And admit that they are tired of being in pain
This book is tragic Let me just say that But it is amazing I recommend this book book to someone who read the book  If I Stayif you have not read that too
I read this book before the movie and all the hype I like that the book was not predictable It was hard for me to put the book down and I read it fairly quickly
One of the saddest books ive ever read and the most touching i won't spoil anything for anybody but i really recommend this book to everyone OKAY  OKAY
Enjoyed this book although it has some sad times Getting to know how these kids handled there illness was very insightful  Want to read more books by John Green
I loved this bookthe only complaint is that there are no more pages =(  It was a seed live story with the perfect balance of humor Absolutely loved the book
These characters are so well developed and intriguing you don't want to stop reading Such a pure love story filled with the ups and downs of real life tragedy
Couldn't put it down  Teens would enjoy too WWII fiction about two lives that intersect unexpectedly  Not as long as it appears-a fast read with short chapters
This book made me cry a beautiful mixture of love laughter and sadness The entire time I read the book I couldn't wait to finish it to find out what happened
Depressing and loving captivating and miserable Hoping the movie doesn't disappoint Just found out my dad has cancer so this comes at a great and horrible time
This book was amazing and had a great story  This was the selection for our book club and I truly expected it to be a sappy teenage drama but it was anything but
I absolutely loved this book It was the sweetest love story Not too lovely dovey but just right It seemed very realistic Loved it and recommend it to everyone
This has to be the best book I've read in some time I was in tears I wanted to read the book before I watched the movie I hope the movie those the book justice
As an adult with terminal cancer this was a hard story to read but it is sweet &amp; compelling providing laughter and tears Wanted to read before I see the movie
the book was ok after a few chapters I predicted how the book would go I knew going into this book it would be sad and I am a huge cry-er but I only cried once
school reading project for my son he says it was not a book he would have read normally and just read the words for school requirements but could not get into it
Brutally honest dictation of one's life with cancer Very heartwrenching love story to add to the mix I wasn't sure if I could finish it But I did and I'm glad
This is the best young adult fiction I've read since The Hunger Games Gripping Lovely Heart rending I think adult women as well as teens will LOVE this book
The Fault In Our Stars is a well thought star  crossed love story that anyone and every one will love No matter how old or how young this is a book for everyone
I could not put this book down  It was very well written You did not feel sad because of the characters having cancer as they had a zest for life in spite of it
This was a great read Touching and funny The subject matter does not exactly make for easy reading but the author manages to make it unsentimental and uplifting
Even though it was predictable it was still a good read  Taught me the definition of eponymous  It was used twice in the book  Cheers for good books
Easy read but it was hard to fully believe teenagers talked/acted like they did However it's a story that you will be talking about long after the book is done
This book is awesome  I was able to connect with the Characters and feel their emotions throughout the entire  story  I would recommend this book  to everyone
This book is a tear-jerker  I really enjoyed reading it It was a well written story; an easy read (but not in a bad way); and it was also pretty funny at times
A beautiful well written book I recommend you read it Life love understanding death unknowing scared amazing and so many other words to describe the book
I think the only reason this is grabbing the attention on tween girls is because they think Agustus is hot  I really got sick of the video game playing
This is a well written and well told story of teenagers with cancer I gave it a five star simply because this book was encapsulating and unputdownable
Nothing compares to a story that welcomes a grateful appreciation for life and love all while crying and smiling Some infinities are bigger than other infinties
Best book ever So sad Well written A beautiful love story that is sure t o warm your Heart I will never forget the story of Agustus Waters and Hazel Lancaster
What a deeply thought provoking bookglad it had an ending It warms my heart for a book to be front and center in a book for young people Read my friendsread
I was excited to read this and already knew the ending It was well written but I was disappointed at the end It left me feeling me feeling deflated and hopeless
If you have heard all the hype don't bother reading it now It was good don't get me wrong but I wasn't moved to the grandiose weeping I've heard others speak of
A great story with fantastic characters An emotional but enjoyable read Really enjoyed listening to the book on audio as well The audiobook was very well done
this book was so touching and amazing I felt like I was really there with hazel grace watching Augustus and being with him it way simply amazing I love this book
This book was predictable but with enough twists to keep it interesting  I read it in less than 2 days  I would recommend it to any reader - past the 8th grade
This book is amazing It made me happysadand angry The worse part is when ‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶ GUS DIES Omg sooo sad:'( You haveeeee to get this book it is awesome
hated the ending I thought this book would be life changing I mean it was good but not the best it kind of ends like the book she loves what happens to Hazel
This was a good book but the ending did not flow with the book A little disapointing Will not go to the theater to see the movie either I will waitand rent it
This is the truest most seemingly real yet fictional novel I've ever read and a beautifully portrayed story about TRUE love Outstanding job John Green; bravo
What is it like to know your time is limited because of cancer in a support group brings three friends together with humour and love helps them deal with living
This is the only book I know that can make me cry Amazing book I read it in one day and I'm not a big reader at all I will recommend this book to all my friends
I strongly recommend this book  Absolutely amazing read even when it gets hard to read you still can't stop reading through your tears I loved this book so much
Wonderfully written and difficult to put downexcept to get tissues Looking forward to the movie but I will need to bring my box of tissueshighly recommend
I loved this book it was so good and I just couldn't stop reading even though it's sad at the end it was amazing I think other people would love reading g it too
Sad compelling story about three young people to whom life has dealt the most painful of hands Great character development  Great use of words Unsettling read
I rated this book with a five because I love how it was written I have fallen in love with this book and I will be sure to suggest this book to all of my friends
Good book for the reading I liked it and was happy to read it when my sister was in the hospital and I had to wait in the waiting room before she had her surgery
This book was a lovely page turning read that will tug on your heartstrings and offer insight into the feelings and struggles of those with cancer young and old
I really enjoyed reading this book I have overcame disease cancer being one of them and am able to relate to this book in some ways Can't wait to see the movie
I love this book It makes you take a better look at what you have I recommend this book to anyone I can't even describe how much I loved it It's indescribable
Beautiful written easy to read and relatable love story You easily fall in love with the characters and Green takes you into the soul of a cancer patient Bravo
I found this book to be lovely &amp; touching  At first I was afraid it would be pretentious but it proved  otherwise  I thoroughly enjoyed it &amp; highly recommend it
The book was such a tear jerker and so inspiring to any reader that's in the mood for an outstanding book full of romance and one's fight to survive in this world
This book was the best book I have ever read I have never laughed and cried so much in my life I recommend this book to anyone out there looking for a good read
Excellent book - very well written and an easy read Character development is great I read it on the plane and had to keep wiping my eyes - very emotional ending
Tears are sliding down my cheeks and I wish I had a love like Augustus and Hazel Just a smaller infinity but nevertheless a great and beautiful one Magnificent
Poignant and a very easy read  Fall in love with characters even though you know you're signing yourself up for heartbreak  By the end of the book it's worth it
This book is amazing yes I cried at a couple of different times but otherwise I loved this book Augustus will always be in my heart I will never forget this book
I absolutely love this book I couldn't stop reading it It I  a very emotional book and I almost cried a few times but h honestly one of my favorite books Enjoy
Such a sweet and tragic love story I highly recommend this book I couldn't stop crying The love these two characters shared was heart warming and inspirational
This book was amazing I could not put it down I will 're-read it over and over again I would recommend this to anyone Especially people who aren't big readers
Excellent book  Beautifullly written  tragic love story cutting deep to real raw emotion  Just enough humor to make it enjoyable without tear jerking Loved it
read it 20 times or moreI totally recommend it to anyoneI really like action but this wasn't action and I still really loved itbetter than hunger games series
This book is a touching story that needs to be read It is sad at some points but if you love books and romance this is for you Best book i ever read hands down
You'll laugh and cry it's amazing I just wouldn't recommend reading it in public like I did a little embarrassing to be crying publicly lol A truly great read
Good bookHeartbreaking at the end but it ends beautifulYou should get this book if you handle sadness and this book has a good sense of humor 
I do hope that the new movie will give the book the justice it deserves This was a beautifully written and loving book Going to read more of John Green 's books
Very touching The narrators sounded convincing Also raises awareness of childhood cancers and the need for continued funds and research for treatments and cures
I am truly moved  tears came within the first 30 pages and finally ended at the end  but still I laughed and hugged my children tighter thank you for this gift
there should be a marketing war between Kleenex &amp; Puffs to sponsor this bookYou will crylest you be soul-less but you will be better for having read it
Cancer in children is never easy to take  Although sad the courage of the teen victims is awe inspiring  I finished this book seeing death in a whole new light
or more trite or less well-written but somehow it isn'tIt is a really well-written well-realized teenage love story I will recommend the hell out of it
This book is by far the best book I have ever read A must read with out a doubt It touches your heart and you don't even know how much until you finish the book
This is my second read of this book and I enjoyed it as much as the first Smart poignant and very real -- you will not be disappointed By far John Green's best
Excellent novel but be forewarned - you will cry  I sobbed throughout my flight to Hawaii - would be a better book for home reading rather than a vacation choice
You know going in that a book about teenage cancer patients might not end happily but this is an excellent book It's such a gripping accurate portrayal of love
Lol I didn't even realize it ended  Beautifully written  Honestly i like it because it puts into words everything all I believe in Its beautiful Just read it
Enjoyed the various characters and their development  Fun  My book club members enjoyed this read and we had an interesting discussion on the various characters
I do not normally read books like this but I an glad that I did It is completely depressing but has a cute story to it I did not think I would cry that much ;_;
I heard about this book from one of my college professors we were talking about kids with cancer and she brought up this book It sparked my interest because she was saying that this book wasn't really about the depressing parts of cancerit was about living even though you have cancer I myself was a 19 year old with cancer and 2 months into remission at the time back into my first college class after chemotherapy I bought this book right after my class ended that day and finished it the following day To say that this book made me almost crazy was an understatement I have never had a book that has made me feel so many emotions When reading this book it really made me feel like someone understood the life of a cancer patient I STRONGLY recommend this book to anyone who has had cancer or even without This book shows you what true love is and what life is  BUY IT It is 100 percent worth it
I was crying for at least 30 min After I heard that Gus had a recurrence  I hated the ending and the author until I read Gus's letterBad bad John Green
This book is amazing it's funny romantic and sad I cried mostly at the end its such a good story You need to get this book it's amazing totally worth the money
this is a must read book i cant put it down you fall in love with the characters A awesome romance story thats the best of the best the good ratings dont lie
This was a most moving story and it was so without being overtly sentimental The prose was oftentimes poetic It felt real like real life Beautifully rendered
Amazing I can't express what this book has do e to me I just wish that the movie was as good as the bookeven thou that was great as well Thank you John Green
Tear jerker Really pretty and slightly angsty but not over the topKind of reminds me of a time travelers wife in that it's a romance that reads like scifi
I loved this book totally worth the money and time Once you start reading you won't want to finish One of those books that changes your perspective completely
This book is so beautifully written that I Cried Out Loud for the characters The feelings were so real it hurt I will definitely read it again multiple times
One of the greatest books I've ever read The movie is good but not as good as the book Pleaseif you've seen the movie order the book You won't regret it
John Green 's writing is superb  The Fault in Our Stars is a stunning look at beauty in the middle of the mess and finding peace in the wake of the unthinkable
Recommended read for anyone who loves someone as cancer can strike anyone  anywhere at anytime unbeknownst to all It is unforgiving but this book is awesome
A true and heroic love story that made me laugh and cry sometimes simultaneously  Poignant and often hilariously sarcastic yet with a touching mix of humility
Despite its many attempts to obscure it reality has no power to disguise truth ~ for truth lives on long after reality ceases to exist A must read ‚ô° :) Mark
This book was absolutely flawless the second I hit the last page I went back to the page before because I didn't want the book to end I would absolutely recommend
Read this book in less than a week couldn't put it down I didn't really like the ending I feel like Hazel wanting to know what happen to the character's on AIA
The way the book touches the human emotions it's beautiful The infinity concept in the book makes it even better Undoubtedly better than the movie must read
This book was absolutely amazing I loved it and support you to read this book too This book is by far the best realistic fiction book I have read in a long time
I like their selfless love and applaud the author (van Houten)  for not giving an ending to satisfy the fans I also like the twist as to anyone can be a grenade
I loved this book and did not want it to end  I enjoyed hearing about the feelings one goes through when faced with a terminal diseaseDefinitely need tissues
I cried and laughed through the whole book Excellent choice fantastic author Recommend to anyone who has battled cancer or knows someone who has battled cancer
What a beautiful book It was so sad and heart wrenching but the words these kids said to each other were things we would all want to hear I loved it-thank you
This book is just amazing The story is heart wrenching honest and beautiful makes you really cherish the people you have around Worth more than five stars
Oh I have laughed a lot and cried hard reading this wonderful story  It is so well written and so clever  You must buy this book  John Green you are genius :)
It was nicely written and I enjoyed the storyline I couldn't quite grasp it at first (I think because I'm older) lol But it was a beautiful story nonetheless
Starts off well enough but then becomes overly contrived and cloying It's protagonists (Hazel and Gus) would roll their eyes in disgust upon finishing the book
I really like the thought provoking storyline It both makes you want to scream because of unfairness and rejoice in the small blessings we can count as our own
This sad book is well worth the time  it is a close and honest look at values  Humor softens the sadness and helps the reader explore what is important in life
I loved how real this book is and how raw the feelings are The author captures you and immerses you in the lives of the characters I couldn't put the book down
Loved the book and went to see the moviea great story Several differences between the two (none-the-less) both were fantastic and would recommend to read/see
I love it I literally highlighted the last eleven pages This book means so much and couldn't be better Time to see the movie I hope it is like the book:)
It's an okay book but I wouldn't say it's anything groundbreaking A good read if you're interested in the possible psychology of somebody suffering from cancer
Really enjoyed this book Every page kept me wanting more and to find out what was going to happen next Highly recommend this for anyone looking for a good read
I cried constantly reminding myself that these were fictional characters Wonderful story  and plot Really inspiring makes you question life and your existence
Great characters intelligent wonderfully crafted story -- gut wrenching and exhilarating a love story that teaches us that pain insists on being felt
This book is one of the best books i have ever read and i would read it again Love it a lot thanks to the author for righting such an inspirational piece of art
I wanted to read the book before I saw the movie  It is a well written very moving novel and now I'm ready to buy my popcorn and bring my Kleenex to the cinema
Helped me see the other side of the parent who struggles with their teen battling cancer It's a story that will touch everyone regardless of their circumstances
This is a sweet book  The character development is well done  Good fast read  Targeted for a younger audience but still enjoyable for those of us much older
I have always empathized but never really imagined what it was like for a family that has a terminally ill child Getting the child's perspective is really novel
this book was amazing it was full of joy and sadness love and fear Please read it it is amazing and John Green is the best writer that I've ever experienced
I loved the story line  Very touching  Even at a young age the true meaning of love is listening &amp; truly caring about that person over &amp; above one's own needs
It will make you cry but it will make you laugh too Characters are very witty It is what you expect it to be for the most part but definitely worth the read
A star crossed lovers tale as old as time but told for today's youth A great read that posses tough questions about life death and the great human experience
This book shows how two kids who have cancer live happy together I would recommend this book to anyone who's able to take some cussing and wants a true love story
Simply amazingAgonizing beautySimplicity at its bestMere perfectionMr Green has captured illness and emotion in this heartwarming novel
I enjoy seeing parts of a book that others highlight  With TFIOS I found myself adding some of my own  It is the best love story I've readtake that Romeo üòè
I couldn't put the book down I cried my eyes out It's like the author said all the right things at all the right times It's amazing how fast things can change
So inspiring I will definitely read it again after getting over some emotions the book brought up inside me Please read I'm hoping to see the movie as well
I think that every one should read this book It makes you look at life differently even though it could make you cry at some points it really is a wonderful book
A well written story on a difficult subject which doesn't make you feel sad just happy for the young people who were able to make the most of every day they had
This book was beyond amazing and I would request it to anyone and everyone This book is so touching and can connect with a lot of people who have lost love ones
This was amazing Highly recommended My friends told me about this book and I didn't know if I wanted to read it but when I started reading I just couldn't stop
with the main character Id be in love with both of them if I we're bisexual Somehow a book about teenage love has elucidated what a true romance should be like
this book was amazing but i suggest you have a few tissues at the ready if you are prone to cry it seems as if i was the only one of my friends who did not cry
This was an amazing and inspiring boom I cried and laughed  I loved the love that evolved between the characters and how they were both fighting for each other
I'm in tears This book has left me speechless I think it was the best book ever written I do not know how the movie is going to live up to the books potential
be ready for tears  it's a great story and was a tearjerker  avoid reading in public places  can't wait to see the movie even though the book is always better
i cried so much i lovee this book i cant waite till this movie comes out I'm counting down the days till it comes out (five stars) but i wish it had more to it
John Green's writing style is very intricate but very easy to read The reader relates to the emotions of the characters and is pulled into the world of the book
While at the hospital today with my husband who is slipping away I read the book and felt less lonely  No person could understand but Augustus and Hazel did
Thinkers experiencers lovers will find this story  validatingI am happy and devastated reading this book Mostly happy that such teens and parents exist
This book is an amazing novel on love and over all life through the eyes of a young girl about my age who has cancer I would definitely recommend this to anyone
I've never cried so hard at a book in my entire life Beautifully written with a wonderful story has the rare ability to make you smile and cry at the same time
Amazing book the best I've read in years Honest funny lovable characters It isn't your usual cancer book - Grace and Gus should be and example for all of us
I loved ever aspect of this book It made me happy and sad at the same time and you truly fall in love with each character I would recommend this book to anyone
You find yourself not sympathising with the characters so much as empathising with them Hats off to Mr Green I will definitely be reading the rest of his works
Iam only 11 years old and I understand what John green means it was inspiring every part of the book it was amazing and such a different topic I have  no words
My daughter loved this book and asked for more by the author so I thought I'd read it too  Read it in two days MIT was good and I enjoyed it  Totally worth it
Ok so I really never review any thing but for this book I had to I couldn't put it down it was so inspiring to me but I would definitely recommend this book
The subject of this novel was unique and powerful I read it because I saw the preview of the movie and thought it looked interesting Definitely worth the read
I haven't been able to read anything lately but this book pulled me right in to the very end Words cannot explain the feelings after and during the entire book
This is by far the best novel that I have read this year It is full of profound thoughts about life and how to appreciate the gift of life  Well said Mr Green
Great book did not see that twist coming It's was a sad story but worth reading I'm not sure how I feel about the characters search for what happened
The Fault in Our Stars is one of the best books I have ever read John Green rocks Read all his books They are amazing and not just for young adults
This book is beautifully written The story is simple &amp; tragic but hopeful You get lost in the two characters pain and celebrate their fleeting glimpses of joy
I don't read a lot But I have to say this book is amazing I love it so much If you are thinking about reading it stop thinking and do it you won't regret it
Very quickly read but also sad too  I wanted to know more once the story ended but it makes sense why it ended the way it had  Highly suggest reading this book
I gave this book 5 stars because it completely deserved it I would recommend this book to almost anyone I'm impressed on how well it's written An amazing book
this book is amazingly written has sad happy and funny parts to it i love and can't for it to come out in theatres I would give it infinite stars if i could
I loved everything A touching story with love paindeathand life All put together by this great author (John Green) I recommend this to everyone and anyone
This book is ridiculously good  I fell in love with the characters  I knew I was in for tears and heartbreak if I continued reading yet I couldn't help myself
The Fault in Our Stars is a blooming love story between Augustus and Hazel It doesn't necessarily end how you want it to but it ends how you would expect it to
I would recommend this book to anyone It is a great story that moves quickly and keeps your attention It is an easy and quick read  I read the book in one day
John Green writes in a style that easily captures the minds of young adults and adults looking for a light read This book was well written if a bit fast DFTBA
it's a perfect mix of serious and sarcastic it's a little sad and unfortunate it feels like you know the characters in real life overall it was perfect enjoy
A well written sensitive and realistic novel of teen coping with cancer and all the complicated relationships in a normal family when cancer makes an appearance
This book was just *sigh*  It was one of the  most loveliest things I've ever read It truly is a work of artI just wish I had read this slower
My teenage granddaughter recommended this book and I couldn't agree more  There is love laughter warmth fear and life well over'  very well written love story
I just finished this book and I am In tears It is just an amazing heart warming story and John green made the characters really come alive It is amazing &lt;3
A GOOD book my daughter read it first and convinced me to read I kinda had an idea of how it would end but it still didn't stop me from bawling my eyes out
There are no words that I can use to express my love for this book I'm glad I seen an advertisement about the upcoming movie that made me want to read this book
Once you read this book you'll never see life the same way and the people around you I always tell everyone to read this book because it really changed my life
Beautifully written The characters were perfect and each had a charming witty sense about them I was laughing I was crying and then laughing again Loved it
Great story with some pleasant surprises and interesting perspectives Well written Inspiring Thought provoking Would definately recommend to anyone of any age
Very well written Characters are easy to love I read in only a few days I don't believe in reviews with spoilers so with that being said buy the book and read
I recommend this book to anyone who wants a good cry at the end Beautifully written I did learn a few new words I couldn't put it down at the end A must read
As a former English teacher I kept thinking how wonderful it would be to read this book with teenagers The characters are engaging the writing witty and SMART
Almost makes up for its sad subject matter I laughed more than I cried Well written It's hard for me to give a sad book 5 stars due to the emotional component
I enjoyed this book  It was an easy read and even though it's a serious subject it was presented in a good way you'll smile laugh and cry but it's a good ride
This unique story is a cancer book without being a cancer book Perhaps because we know up front that the main character has cancer it's less of a stark topic of the book yet having a terminal illness is a constant theme I guess I want to tell people not to put this story aside just because it deals with cancerit's such a great book on so many levels it shouldn't be shelved so easilyIt's also in the Young Adult category but if I hadn't known that I wouldn't categorize it as YA myselfThis is a love story and John Green does such a good job casting Hazel the main character in a way that we really get to know her get to go inside her head and understand her dilemmas her faults her strengths her desiresI'm amazed at how easy this book was to read yet it's so complex it's topics heavy it's story thick and rich I wholeheartedly recommend it
teen daughter loved this so apparently a good book if you are a teenage girl John Green does a lot of YouTube stuff for school and education so good man
This was an intersting book Plot is ok charectars are ok etc However there is quite a bit of language Overall three stars okay book but not outstanding
It is an amazing book with many feelsOkayOkayThis thing says 10 more words are required soHi hi hi hi hi hi hi hi hi hi
All time favorite book &amp; second favorite movie You'll laugh you'll cry you'll be unsure as to how to carry on with your life after you're finished reading it
Saw the movie first so read the book  I usually find books to be better than the movie  This was equally good  Can not say I liked one better than the other
I love this book it I book of fighting love and loss It speaks to me in a way I can't explain it a beautifully written book and I would recommend it to everyone
lovingbuteefultragicare you a virginWell this book is my alltime faveroit book if i had to choose this would be the only book in the world for a fact
I give this book a five star rating because I loved the book so much I also loved how it was about cancer and how it makesyou think that hazel is going to die
Just so amazing  John Green is truly a very talented writer The end was a twist in every different direction it was just a book that was simple yet not simple
This book is absolutely and utterly amazing I strongly suggest that you purchase this book It is sad happy inspiring and funny all rolled up into a book :)
This was a very well-written amazing love story that made me laugh out loud and burst into tears Spoiler* I do wish I knew what happened to Hazel after the end
Sweet memorable story with characters I loved Eye-opening about the world of cancer kids For that alone worth the read but also a great story that moved me
This book is so amazing The way the characters think amazes me like I have never th thought about it that way Such a beautiful book I applaud you John Green
I have read many books but this one is by far the best book ever it's got some romance and also it tells people that there are many people who have cancer too
Literally the best book I have ever read My favorite book of all time And I will definitely be reading more books by John Green Absolutely an amazing author
How can you not tear up while reading this book Cancer has become apart of all our lives so relating to the story was easy for me I wi definitely see the move
Sad very but a great read Loved the quotesShakespeare and English metaphors Had to be written by someone we'll versedread and knowledge of the  English lang
My step-mom is battling breast cancer and has been for almost two years She is an amazing women and has never lost hope This book means a lot to me personally
splendid read characters were all I hoped they'd be Tear jerker if you have any kind of compassion in you're heart Love the ending calming closure for Hazel
I read this book over a spread out period of time and each time I picked it up I instantly remembered where I left off Great story can't wait to see the movie
This book is absolutely amazing A must read It's an emotion rollercoaster but wow It's very beautifully written This is a book I'd read over and over again
I think for a book typically written for a YA genre it was well written and gives one a pause to how we relate to one another and are impact here in our lifetime
I think it was a fantastic book But why did the ending end like it did if that makes sense But other than that it one of my favorite books that I've ever read
I can't say I know what goes on in a 16 year old girl's mind especially a very bright young woman with terminal cancer  But Green sure seems to know  Does he
Heartfelt Good writing It makes you wish for something above average in life I would recommend anyone who just needs a new novel to enjoy to pick this one up
Very funny although subject matter was notI fell in love with Augustus myself and was teary eyed when he died I would recommend it to all ages not just teens
Was a beautiful story even though I cried through the whole book it also made me realize that we need to notice the small things in life that make it beautiful
Well written in a way one could only hope to write with such orchestrated thoughts The wit and depth of characters is mesmerizing I highly recommend this book
Cute love story Very sad position both kids faced with their health  Showed a lot of courage and strength The dialogue at times seemed well beyond their ages
I enjoyed this book very much  It is an easy read that's keeps you interested  It is humorous and sweet  I would have given 4 point something If I could have
Excellent book It evoked laughter sadness and even anger all in one book It really put you in Hazel's shoes and I would suggest this book to everyone I know
I love this book It's a very cute love story with a sad ending Everything about and in the book was amazing I never liked reading very much then I found this
I came across this book searching for best sellers I could have dine without the vocabulary test but it would have taken away from hazels character Great book
This book was thought provoking real and very down to earth I would recommended this book to others especially those who have been affected by cancer before
This book was like no other it was unique in its plot and amazing I loved how John Green captured the life of this girl with cancer it was completely amazing
you're probably never going to read a book that plays quite as many notes of human emotion as this one does do yourself a favor; read this book and feel alive
I cannot help but love and hate John Green for repeatedly breaking my heart with his books  He is an amazing author and really knows how to tug on heartstrings
I can't wait to see the movie John green did a phenomenal job writing this book :) If you're not much of a reader at least read this book you won't regret it
I gave this book five stars because unlike other love stories that seem so unreal this seemed real it seem natural I cried I laughed but most important I feel
Although it is a book of fiction so much of it seems real beautiful love story I wish not to say any more as it could give away the story All should read
A very fast read that you can't put down Very poignant funny and moving and although a fictional story about the lives of young adults with cancerquite real
I've read this book twice now and I plan on reading it many more I felt like the movie definitely did the book justice Hope you enjoy it as much as I did/do (:
I would highly recommend it to anyone  You really love the characters and it was the first book that made me actually cry  Hope the movie is just as well done
What a beautiful way to acknowledge death of childrenI was very impressed with this author John GreenHe didn't sugar coat this horrific diseaseWell done
I really enjoyed this book it was  was so well written I could not put it down What an amazing look into the lives of these people experiencing ups and downs
I really enjoyed this book The characters especially Augustus were great I would recommend this book to anyone looking for a true story of hope love and life
The book is fast-paced and gets the reader interested from the get go  I wanted to read the book before I saw the movie  Hope the movie is as good as the book
I did like this book The ending was expected by me So I can't say I was disappointed but I am slightly Overall it was very well written and really was great
Amazing Best book I have read in awhile Of course you know it involves cancer but it has just the right amount of comedic relief  Have some tissues available
This book will make you smile laugh and cry It takes you on a thrilling journey with unexpected twists and outcomes Highly recommend it Best book ever made
This book is perfect I personally enjoyed reading the book I loved it from the beginning I wish the book never ended But all good things must come to an end
I had several people recommend this to me saw previews for the movie version so I decided to give it a try Read it in two nights I just couldn't put it down
this book is a great book to read I read it in just 2 days because I couldn't put it down if the movie isnt exactly like the book I'm going to be really sad :(
I feel like this book spoke from the heart of young people and how they view the world While we know how the book ends the journey is amazing sweet and real
You get so involved with the story that you just can't put the book down  You have to go on to the next chapter I cried pretty much from chapter 13 to the end
A very unique story and touching which will make you understand love and hardships You won't be able to put this book down One of the best books I've ever read
This is a wonderful and difficult book to read It not only gives great insight on the battle with cancer but the angst of being a teenager coming of age as well
Absolutely the most heart wrenching epic love story Absolutely fell in love with the characters I would recommend this book to any and every person I know
The Fault in Our Stars is a sad but sweet story I found myself crying but I also laughed I fell in love with the characters in the story as much as Hazel did
An amazing story Beautifully written Hilarious Loving Sad I don't knowi don't know mind blowing O my God I hate everything but I also love anything
I not only liked this book but I fell in love with itI would recommend this book to everyone and anyoneIt is truly and heart touching love story üíï
Amazing book Absolutely amazing It isn't completely depressing like you would think a book about a kid with cancer would be It's an interesting point of view
This was a good book to provoke discussion at our book club  That said it is really a young adult book and gives some insight into to what teens are thinking
this book was amazing and I enjoyed reading it It's sort of like a more modern version of Romeo and Juliet This book is one of the best books I have ever read
A book about a girl dying of cancer who has an obsession with a book about a girl dying of cancerthis  is a beautiful love story but also heartbreakingly sad
this book is so good  the kind of books that i used to read are dystopia but a friend told me about this one  and i love it  i was crying when Gus died 
The story is a bit convoluted but I was gratified with gaining insight into how young people deal with life and death issues after they have a cancer diagnosis
I am not much of a fiction reader but I was really moved by this story The story drew me in and was looking forward to each night when there was time to read
if i learned anything from this book its how to love and treat people i hope to be a little bit more like Hazel &amp; Augustus and a little less like Van Houten
Great read Very fast readpredictable but still I great fictional story  Not sure what age this book is shutting for nut might be difficult for the younger one
It was no my sisters keeper but it wasn't trying to be The complex thoughts the main characters allow you to reevaluate your perspective on existence
All the way through I kept telling myself I wasn't going to like the ending It's a book about cancer patients But I couldn't put it down Sad but well written
This was one of the beat books on grief dealing with mortality sickness and love The writing was excellent The story line infallible One of my favorite books
A very touching romantic beautiful funny story Such a great story that many people might relate to One of the best teen non fiction stories I have ever read
I LOVED THIS BOOK and I thought that it was amazing and that everybody should read itand the author and I have the same last name it's pretty cool
PAIN RIGHT IN THE FEELS Seriously though this is an amazing book The writing was a bit over my head in parts but I guess that's what dictionaries are for
Read it I'm glad I did It was funny sad and endearing I read it in a day because I couldn't put it down So read itThere's nothing more to say
Excellentwell written incredible characters emotionally charged; I was teary eyed and heartbroken right along with Hazel Gus and Isaac  Inspirational
What else can i say This book was simply awesome I recommend this for anybody really It just shows that love stories can come out of anything even a disease
I could not put the book down until I reach the final page tears swelled over my eyes I've got forever in a limited time which was infinite to Gus and Hazel
this book was the second best book I have ever read (following hollow city) hazel and Augustus are (or were) perfect I was freaking out when I saw the trailer
I did read this in one sitting because I was interested and it was a good book But it just wasn't one of those books I want to tell everyone to go out and read
I was recommended to read this book so i did And this book is so far the best book i have ever read It was a sad/happy book so it made me enjoy it even more
This is the best book I have read in the start of 2014 I wasn't expecting the ending I was so moved by the end that I was in tears for the last three chapters
This book is a wonderful example of a tragic and triumphant love story that makes me feel like a hopeless romantic It's a wonderful read and well written Bravo
Touching and heartfelt story about love The disease that both Hazel and Gus had did not stop them from falling in the most beautiful romance in this modern era
It us an amazing book filled with romance adventure and sorrow It is the perfect book that defies a perfect tragic love story The newest Romeo and Juliet
I love this book it is an amazing love story and at some points I almost cried This book like the title says is AMAZING I will suggest this book to everyone
A great read I read this book in under 24 hours because I could not put it down and if I could would live to experience it for the first time again and again
The Fault in our Stars really made me think about love and I realized: There's no way I could ever love like Gus and Hazel Grace well maybe someday we all can
It has been a long time since I have felt this deeply for characters There were moments that I laughed out loud and others that made me sob Brilliant dialogue
This is lovely funny and nicely walks a thin line between too sentimental and too much that line that shows us beauty in life despite this being about cancer
This book was absolutely amazing The word choice was spectacular and the story was beautiful Unless you have a heart of stone you will cry at the end of this
I was really engaged in this novel and really recommend it everyone even if it is in the Young Adult category i like to break those things anyway (categories)
I've read this many times and I can honestly say that it gets better each time Anything by John Green is going to be wonderful but this is my personal favorite
my daughter has to read so much time every day  it's great to be able to pick out a book and download in less than 5min vs going to the library to pick one out
I wasn't sure what to expect when I bought this but when I started it I couldn't put it down  I laughed and cried and felt inspired all in one  Beautiful book
This book has the right amount of everything I love the way John Green articulates existence (and I tried to think of a different way to say that but I cannot)
My vocabulary fails me in describing this book My heart is beating faster and my mind is that much more imaginative Excellent Thanks Jada for recommending it
The book was one of the best I've read in a while However when I was reading it I kept thinking that teenagers don't speak like the way they do in this story
This was a book club selection which some members found very disturbing  The book was well written and I could almost feel the suffering of the main characters
Everything about this book made me feel I laughed a lot It twisted in directions I didn't expect I cried too I've never cried at a book before Just read it
Bawled my eyes out I never cry during a book It was so sweet if a slightly predictable to begin with I didn't see how it would all pan out in the end at all
Even though this is a YA read I couldn't put it down  It is so well written and so inspiring but in a real-life way  I would recommend this book to everyone
Enjoyable story for teens and adults  Each characters courage in the face of the unexpected was encouraging  I hope e movie lives up to the promise of the book
Cried my eyes out while laughing throughout the whole book  Great story great characters I would recommend this to anyone looking for a quick meaningful read
well written book that gave interesting insight into someone who suffers with cancer especially a child I would recommend this to  teenagers as well as adults
Possible spoiler alert My daughter pre-ordered this book so she could get an autographed copy John Green autographed the entire first printing Her first autographed copy had little more than a squiggle in it and she lost that one but I was able to get another autographed copy from a bookstore in Chicago and that had a better autograph She was hoping for a Hankler fish--a drawing from John's brother Hank that only appears in a few books She didn't get that but she loves the book anyway It's just a great story about two unusual teenagers who may not be like you but you like them anyway and empathize strongly with them I highly recommend this book for teenagers It might not be suitable for the 9-12 year old set as it deals with emotional issues they may not be ready to deal with (two friends dying of cancer--I hope that wasn't a spoiler for anyone) But it's a wonderful book
CRY CRY &amp; CRY somemore But I love it A book that can make you feel such a strong emotion such as sadness for the characters thats some darn good literature
Dialogue moved the story and characters along so that you cannot put the book down Plan ahead for reading this book; you will want to finish it in one sitting
I would totally recommend this book to everyone I think this book was mostly about three teenagers trying to find the meeting of love life happiness and pain
I laughed I cried And I do believe this book isn't a book It is an art that fills your heart with emotion and adds that little bit of curiosity to your mind
This was a quick read  The story flows wellFunny sarcasm and witty characters keep this book realistic  A bit sad but helps you see the bigger picture
This book is absolutely amazing  It's heartfelt and so true for real life Cancer and non-cancer victims alike need to read this  I can't recommend it enough
I do not think I can describe this book at the moment because I finished reading it about two minutes ago and I am still crying Just read it Nothing compares
A wonderful read A tear-jerker Somehow John Green manages to portray a teenage girl but also write with amazing poise and vocabulary and it all fits together
This book exceeded my expectations in every possible way I laughed I cried My heart literally ached I am only sorry it took me so long to decide to read it
This is the fourth John Green book I've had the pleasure of reading and just like the rest I was not unsatisfied John Green is now one of my favorite authors
I read this book in a day with a head cold so it's definitely a solid read I would have liked to connect with the characters more but I still liked the book
I have read a fair amount of books in my short life and this one is probably a hard one to beat even though I still have a lot more years of reading ahead of me
The book was better than I expected Certainly written with the 'tween/teen in mind Read it because my granddaughter read it &amp; saw the movie It was well-done
Moving story about kids with cancer that was uplifting not depressing  Really enjoyed the clarify of the writing and the depth of emotion it caused me to feel
Excellent writing I couldn't put it down Loved the characters but I felt the story line dropped toward the end I bought another of his books when I was done
Could not put this book down It was such a great read I am looking forward to reading more books by this author and to watching the movie It's a must read
A great way of facing adversity and still loving the life you have such an inspiration to anyone that whatever is happening in your life to still find the good
I enjoyed the story and the characters An easy read that was pretty predictable but still entertaining Recommended for a nice break from heavier story lines
This book brings a completely teenager humorous side to cancer family and love John Green wrote a beautiful story that I will probably re-read a dozen times
Very good I enjoyed it reminds me how short life really is and that you need to enjoy it one day at a time cuz you will never really know how long you have left
I chose this rating because this book was very very good I loved it even though it took me a little while to read it  but I loved everything about the book
This book made me cry laugh and stirred up anger Loved the story and the way I felt reading this book It awoke the curiosity I use to have as a young reader
Great book I'm 17 year old male and I couldn't put it down It definitely get emotional and tears your heart apart but opens up your mind to the idea of cancer
This provides a great insight into the thoughts and feelings of teens with cancer The straight forward and often crass humor they aquire is shocking and funny
An insightful look at life and death with the accompanying struggle of facing oblivion and anonymity  A relatively easy but contemplative read  Much enjoyed
It was kind of slow getting started for me but after I kept reading (at the encouragement of my daughter) it was an awesome book and I'm glad I read to the end
I have to say this is the best modern-day book I have read by far I am very happy with the purchase and it is just a beautifully done phenomenal piece of art
Oh my God it was absolutely amazing written beautifully it made me cry at times and also made me laugh like a crazy personbest book I have ever read by far
This is a great love story It's different from others considering they are both sick but it makes it a good story to be reading I can't wait to see the movie
still reading but what i read so far i like it  I wanted to see the movie when it was out i never got there so i order the book on my kindle so far i like it
Not super realistic all of the time but still a great read I would recommend it to anyone I enjoyed the book Nice ending for a book about teens with cancer
This book was excellent I recommend thus book 100% The Fault in Out Stars was a book about two young teens with cancer who fall in love I loved this book&lt;3
this book was amazing but the movie was totally different I cried for a while and I would recommend this book to everyone sorry this is a shifty review but ya
Even though this book was young adult it was very adult Saw the movie also and it was very much like the book  It was wonderfully written with great emotion
Wonderful read  Touches the heart and soul  Expresses the feelings of the patient parents family and friends in a way I never imagined their feelings were
I read this book in two days it takes you to a different world where all the things we take for granted don't exist Amazing writer can't wait to see the film
Although Java sad story It feels you with faith and courage I don't like tva amazon decides how much you should foment if this the case I will skip that part
Wonderful Story I couldn't seem to put the book down Beautifully written and such a quirky sense of humor  The characters are perfectly suited to be friends
truly inspiringit is sointelligent and wonderfully written I love how he uses his choice of words to explain the amazing love between hazel and Augustus
Such a great book Sad though so get your kleenex ready The movie was pretty good too I liked the ending to the movie better actually  but all around great
This book is amazing I love it I cried most of the book and spent the whole day reading it I recommend this book to anyone who love tragic romantic comedies
A little depressing but still a nice story Not sure I would see the movie  because it's not the kind of movie that would have a lot of visual or sound effects
An easy ready but a good one Worth the read Green captured something unique in this book both the angst of teen love and heartbreak and also of tragic loss
Despite the fact you know it deals with cancer and it's going to be depressing this was a funny uplifting and inspiring book that I would recommend to anyone
Loved reading this heartfelt story of young love family challenge and real life Thanks to my niece for making me aware of this book in prep to see the movie
Love it made me cry many times It's very touchingand romantic I'm in love this book I recommend this book to anybody who likes romance and can start sorrow
This book has wonderful character  Clever without being weighed down by sentimentalityThe characters will stay with you long after the book is finished
I loved this book I didn't cry though I sobbed that book is ridiculously sad But I still love that  book not only do I like this one but I also love paper towns
I loved that this book actually took place in Indiana and described the places so well I felt I was there  I enjoyed the book and I hope the movie stays true
I cried the last 3 chapters or so it makes you realize how precious your life is How we harm those we love even while loving them whole and unconditionally
I feel honored to have read this book A story which demands to be noticed Your mind heart and soul will be affected by the beauty of The Fault in Our Stars
Very emotional book indeed first few chapters are a little boring (to me rather) but it gets better Just like life in a way its boring but it gets better
Great book The author does a great job in writing this book and speaking to a large audience You feel as though you know the characters or can relate to them
Makes you want to live your days to the fullest  Read the book on a long train ride--it was an easy yet entertaining read  I definitely teared up a few times
Refreshingly honest I loved the writing style I wish he did adult novels as well Although the book was fairly short nothing at all seemed rushed or lacking
This book gives just a little insight to what it is like to walk around with cancer or a disease the author did a great job can't wait to read more of his books
Kept my interest Quick readI recommend this book but can be depressing to some people If you don't like to read about sick children this book is not for you
Loved the author's use of languagebrilliantly writtenI did not make it through the book without tearsExcellent booka must read
Beautiful just beautiful It probably isn't realistic for teenagers to speak with the level of sophistication used in this book but it made for a lovely read
There is a little infinity that lives in your heart after you read this book Gus and Hazel steal your heart and John Green's writing is captivating Read TFIOS
I got this book on Monday and I finished it today (Thursday) I couldn't stop readingIt starts out with humor then goes into love then it gets sad
Just as they searched for the ending-I also wished for an ending A smartsadand creative writing  Definitely a page turner I just wanted a few mire pages
I bought this for my daughter  She is an avid reader and this is by far her very favorite book  She is a huge John Green fan and this book did not disappoint
A poetic journey through the eyes of people you think are too young to understand love I can't praise this book enough It was heartfelt in all the right ways
I loved this book If your looking for a book READ THIS BOOK I really recommend reading this book because it has so many things that really make you think
Thank you John Green As a single adult survivor of an incurable cancer I found this book improbably therapeutic and cathartically revolutionary - D L Edwards
I read this book in order to have a commonality with my 14 year old step-daughter who'd read it for a class I found it entertaining pertinent funny and sad
Just emotional One of the best read books this yearThe love between Hazel Grace &amp; Augustus is just beautiful I cried the entire last 1/3rd of the book
Words cannot express how much I truly love this story Never before have I read anything like it and I doubt I ever will again Grab tissues you'll need them
John Green could write the ingredients on the back of a cereal box and I would love it A Fault In Our Stars made me happy and sad in all the right ways Bravo
Had me teary for the majority of it Read it in a night will read again I generally stray away from relationshippy stories but this was bigger Very touching
I thought the book was clever and well written  The subject of cancer isn't light or happy but the love story is uplifting as is the story of the family bonds
I'm not sure if I agree with every ideology or colloquium but I agree that this book will be remembered it has left its scar And what a beautiful scar indeed
Another great read from John Green I have yet to be disappointed with anything John and Hank put their marks on I will keep searching from now until oblivion
This charming YA book really got me on the emotional level John Green is such a talented writer and he does a great job portraying the voice of a teenage girl
It was a good story except once it ends its kind of disappointing It was enjoyable to read but in the end the foreshadowing made the ending oh so predictable
I definitely got pulled into this story The characters their struggles and triumphs and their viewpoints on life (and the side effects) was very well written
I feel as is if I was slowly dying (much like the characters) in the most beautiful and strangely addicting way as I read this book Which was only a day after starting it Me being a slightly cowardly person the type that if something is sad or painful I normally choose not to acknowledge it's existence However I can't say that I have any regret in reading the complex yet simple funny yet heart-achingly sad story of this book ( Well I  could but I'd  be lying)  Unlike in most YA books the female narrator did not repulse me nor was the plot of a young girl who is bound f o r ultimate death so depressing it was unreadable It made look at life differently which is such a cliche it pains me to say it How ever in the grand scheme  of things I would highly recommend  reading this bookSincerely  A teenagerPS- We are all just a side effect
Time is precious and this book is worth the time taken to read it because it might make other minutes of your life more valuable by appreciation and awareness
LOVE THIS BOOKüòç I can't stop reading it over and over again Thank You for the goodness of this story that touched my heart and emotions in both ways Yay
I tore through this book in a day I couldn't get enough of it even though it left me trying to explain to everyone why I'm boo hooing for seemingly no reason
If for teenagers; he should of left out their love making Otherwise it was great This could be for college students but not for middle school or high school
THIS WAS LIKE THE BEST BOOK I HAVE EVER READ I had read this book in less than 2 days I could not stop that all I think that everyone should read this book
I read this book in only three sittings I got so very hooked I wish it had continued a bit longer but maybe the ending was supposed to be a reminder of AIA
Well written I personally felt as if I were Hazel It's a great book with well thought out details I absolutely love the book now I must go watch the movie
:( A little sad but it makes you look at life for what it is Not forever Makes you be conscientious as well for people that fight these types of battles
Hazel and Gus were wonderful young people with old souls  I will look at my life and living in a much different way thanks to them  Loved this book 5 stars
Good book interesting read and overall good book I would recommend it to others I am not sure I've had enough tragedy in my life to completely understand it
This book instantly takes you into the world of an ambitious yet humble heroine A deeply touching realistic beautiful story about the human condition- love
Loved but had to bust out my dictionary a few times It was a bit of a challenge but not too arduous Took me two days to finish but was totally worth it=^¬∑^=
I stayed up till 3 in the morning to finish this book It was so sad but totally true  I don't know if I want my 14 year old granddaughter reading it or not
I feel like I was privileged to witness Hazel's reconciliation with the world This felt honest and raw and not unlike my own wars with reality vs perception
Wonderful read-- candid writing with great humor throughout Interesting viewpoint on battling cancer especially through the eyes of a teen Highly recommend
This book is not about a pleasant subject but well presented Shows there is always hope and even when hope fails life is still there and with special moments
Refreshing insightful and beautiful There isn't much more to say except to quote Hazel and Augustus okayokay Read it and you will understand
I know this is a YA book but I loved it It was well-written and pretty dang amusing for a story about teens with cancer Looking forward to seeing the movie
A book about cancer that's not about cancer People are not their illness Great read for anyone who has ever known someone with an illness that is everyone
I loved this book It was so well written and I couldn't wait to finish it Very different from recent fiction I have read I would highly recommend this book
I loved this book It couldn't have been any better This is the best book I've ever read I hope there's a sequel though it won't be as good without Augustus
I loved this book Why  did it have  to end :( my sister recommended this book I wish she didn't I couldn't stop crying after you know what happened :(
This story was not just a story that had passion fire and a little bit of humor  This story showed me what a true friendship is and what true love is about
Not as great as it was hyped up to be  Very honest authoring and a very good pov from a teens perspective but much more predictable than I would have liked
Thus book is absolutely amazing from start to finish the book is captivating and extremely hard to put down Really makes you appreciate what you have in life
Amazing story Helped me understand life's struggles a little better and How to treat and look at a terminal illness Person a a little more helpfully Loved it
I enjoyed reading The Fault In Our Stars Yes it was realistic and sad but it was also uplifting at times I would recommend it to friends as a very good read
What a outstanding  bookwe would like to consider things as neatly as Gusloved his opinionswould have liked to hear more from Isacc
This book was so good at times sad but I ready like it I really like the style of it and the story was very good The romance and the darker times of life but
Great quotes now I'm left wondering what happens to Hazel her family Issac etc I loved everything about Augustus and Hazel's relationship I want more
Great read  Drew me in although I was a somewhat reluctant reader  I would recommend to anyone who has been touched by the topic especially the young adult
Fantastic book from start to finish I am not a reader personally but I couldn't put this book down Read it in three days and that's saying something for me
I love this book There are no words to describe how amazing and unique this is John Green did amazing job and I can't wait to see what else he comes up with
This book was amazing I laughed I cried and I gained some new insight on life This is definitely a great read and I plan on reading it again down the road
An emotional ride that *almost* made me cry on the bus But I prevailed and enjoyed this modern day classic of an intelligent teen battle with nature's faults
Very well written  I wad hesitant to read it because I can get pretty emotional but it was well worth it and not the normal you can see what is coming book
Beautiful honest story about the beauty and tragedy of life  He captivated such an important story of two young cancer patients trying to navigate the world
Beautifully written modern love story Feels as though you are watching the characters through a window or as a bystander I promise you you will shed a tear
Didn't live up to the hype  I did not get it  I didn't empathize with the characters  I didn't care about their deaths and their wishes - ughGdeering
This book is funny romantic and sad all at the same time It allows the readers to understand what the character are feeling and the emotions that they share
This book brought smiles and a little sadness It was a page turner I love how vivid the writing was and his way of story teller Josh Green is very talented
Whipped throughout the book in two nights  Slow start to get into the book but once into itthe journey is quick but not painless  Very emotional story
This story was very touching and had me crying at certain parts John Green is a very talented writer I really enjoyed this story and I hope you will also :)
I love this book It was a realistic love story No fairy tale perfect love story So many people go through this and I'm sure many can relate Excellent book
I really liked this book A funny romantic teenage love story Was just long enough Twist in the story really engaged you and kept you wanting to read more
I like the unexpected twists and extra characters in this read Great perspective on living dying and everything in between Expect a few tears along the way
I gave this book a 5 star rating because it brings truth to what happens in life and how things are never how they turn out to be ThAt's why I love this book
IT WAS A TRULY EXCEPTIONAL BOOK OF LOVE THAT IS TRUE LOVE IF I DO SAY SO MYSELF GOOD READ  I WOULD RECOMMEND TO HAVE LOTS OF TISSUES WITH YOU WHILE READING
Read in two sittings Absolutely  phenomenal I laughed criedsmiled Highly recommend this book to all readers It will be hard to find a book that compares
What a great realistic and truly emotional story It really makes you think about life and how lucky we are regardless of the situation to be able to live
Started slow but kept reading and about fourth into the book I couldn't put it down  I have recommended this book to friends  Not sure I will see the movie
Friends have recommended this book and now I'm sorry I took so long A tragic yet amazing love story that everyone should read Word of advice - bring tissue
The Fault in Our Stars was a wonderful love story about 2 young people that fall in love fight cancer and going on an unpredictable and unexpected journey
Very quick and romantic read I wish the 2 teenagers were adults Also they were very intellectual when they spoke A bit too much Overall the book was great
Great book Kept my attention throughout the whole book Not overly wordy or descriptive but a great love story It grabbed my heart and held it until the end
Absolutely loved this book Couldn't put it down I know I will be disappointed with the movie nowbbecause it probably won't match up to the book's excellence
Lovely story about the ugly realities of life Hazel Grace is sarcastically funny making her seem as real almost anyone I know Best book I've read in a wgile
a great read and not too time consuming unless you count the amount of self reflecting you'll do as a side effect of reading this intoxicating work of fiction
THIS IS THE BEST BOOK EVERRRRR Where can I find an Augustus waters who will be ever so metaphorically romantic Just read this damn book okay Okay
I LOVE THIS BOOK SOOOOOOOO MUCH I'M GOING TO SEE THE MOVIE TOMORROW NIGHT THIS BOOK IS SOOOOOOO GOOD AND I RECOMMEND THAT YOU READ IT I LOVE THIS BOOK

I loved it but it did make me cry Very inspiring and heart breaking story A must read If the book made me cry this much I don't even want to see the movie
What an incredible work I can't wait to see the movie I definitely recommend this book especially to those whom are struggling with the lost of a loved one
I heard so many rave reviews about this book so my children got it for me for Mothers day Sooo good and I couldn't put it down I am anxious to see the movie
The fault in our stars is amazing It takes a lot to get me to cry but this book was so touching that i did I love this book and would recommend it to anyone
Beautiful ending yet I'm left with many questionsthis book was a page turner and extremely hard to put down I'm definitely going to see this in the movies
It was pretty good in general Some parts I thought weren't nesasary and I don't like how Augustas ends up dieting instead of Hazel I didn't like van houghte
Author's love of language and subject matter shine through  BEAUTIFULLY written novel  Painful subject but delicately treated  Feel honored to have read it
Reading this book made me think very hard and had my emotions everywhere It made me feel like I was Hazel Grace Lancaster and that Augustus was my boyfriend
An amazing story John Green had me completely lost in my feelings I would recommend this to all ages This is a book I wouldn't mind reading again and again
After her fellow support group member becomes blind Hazel tells him too bad bc she has gotten hotter Just one of many piercing moments in this stunning book
My 12-year old daughter says The best book ever It's so sad though I definitely recommend this book It's funny also It is confusing sometimes
This book was amazingly written and if you love love stories that make you cry and fall in love with the characters I definitely recommend reading this book:)
I enjoyed the perspective I got from this book  It is very easy to read and pulls you in quickly  I will enjoy thinking about this book for sometime to come
What a great story Not an ill fated or typical type romance it's justreal I think that's what I liked about it It was like you would know these people
This book is one of my favorites If you haven't read it you should The writing is amazing the characters are amazing and overall the story was incredible
One of those books that will leave you finding it hard to read another book afterwards because nothing could even compare to how it moved you  Book hangover
Wow amazing how invested you can get in a character in just a few chapters  Life lessons learned remember to enjoy each day and cherish the people you love
This was and amazing story  It was very sad at times however I loved how no matter how sad it was never too depressing to read and I always wanted to read it
I enjoyed this book but as a 30 something the writing was a bit juvenile Still I could connect with the characters and enjoy the plot well enough
This was the best love story I've ever read Words can't describe my feelings enough Just amazing I will hold Gus and Hazel close to my heart Beautiful
This book was amazing although the ending was cut dramatically I loved this book I recommend it to all kinds of people This book should be read by everyone
The Fault in our Stars is just so amassing I just wish it ended a bit differently I finished it in 4 hours You just can't put it down Wonderful wonderful
This book is smart very funny and just so happens to have a tragic star-crossed love story to boot I couldn't put it down and you won't be able to either
This book made me laugh and tear up It just struck me as real As a reader I loved it As a parent maybe I gained some perspective I pray I will never need

Amazing book unique story and extremely well written the first John green book I have read but it won't be the last looking forward to the movie coming out now
Yes I recommend this I hope you don't mind crying but totally with my tears Just if your in school Don't read the second half in class I made that mistake
The fault in our stars is a terribly sad book with a beautiful meaning I absolutely loved it and was hooked the moment I started reading it Bravo John Green
John Green has to be the best writer in history I have read this book and An abundance of Katherines They are both reallly good This is the best book ever
The author uses fascinating language to describe his sometimes funky sometimes hilarious often tragic but always interesting characters I laughed and cried
Very moving book giving me a different perspective on life One of my new all time favorites I love all of the quotes and plan to read more John Green books
This is one of the most most saddest but funniest books I have read ever And I have read a lot of books I love this book and will read it over and over again
Absolutely breath-taking- a mix of love humor romance and of course tragedy Green couldn't have done a better job Honestly the best book I have ever read
Honestly I have read this book a few times and it gets better every time I love Gus His love for her could move mountains This book is almost awe inspiring
Very thought provoking book Makes you wonder who will remember you when you die and do you really care I'm glad to have people around me that matter so much
This book was so touching and made you really think about what love truly is and not what it is made to be I would recommend this book to anyone Amazing read
I devoured this book as it in turn shattered me This is one of those books that reached into my soul and left fingerprints This book is exquisite Read it
Just thought that you should be warned  This does not mean that you should not read  I just think you should prepare the ice cream chocolate and Kleenexes
A beautiful story worth reading regardless of the types of genres you like I cried throughout many parts of it but fell in the characters and their stories
Where do I start Every part of this book was amazing You will laugh cry cheer and re-read favorite quotes The only downside to this book is that it ends
Honestly this book is amazing in my eyes It's a beautiful love story I will never forget and with every emotion this masterpiece oh out I genuinely felt it
Augustus and Hazel share a love that spoke deeply to me and I just couldn't put the book down or stop crying everyone should read the Fault In Our Stars ASAP
I laughed a lot; I cried a little and I smiled at the end Such a wonderful book I read it in a few hours and can't wait to read more of John Green's books
This was a very enjoyable interesting book that I felt gave a very intriguing look at the insight that may happen with being young and ill Good for all ages
I absolutely loved this book read it for 3 days straight and cried t the end It was written expertly even though I couldn't read few of the words MUST BUY
A wonderful book about real teenagers dealing with life threatening illness with humour and intelligence  I have read this book twice and loved it both times
This book is simply amazing It made me laugh and cry and it is just a very moving book It's a book that makes you think and feel and really think about life
Beautiful young adult novel the main characters are deep and interesting and super intelligent It treats the subject of sickness and death with such nuance
I found it amazing how much I could relate to the situations that Hazel and Gus went throughI especially remember the beginning of the book where they were in Cancer support group  John Green describes exactly how it feels to be in a support group like that  Now I don't have cancer mine is a mental illness but I have felt and thought about all the things Hazel and Gus hadNow I read a lot of people cried or teared up while reading some of this book  I didn't but I still found much of the book endearing and truthful  The connection between the main characters was at times funny loving and scary  I say scary because they both take chances with loving each other just as anyone else would be taking Even though some of the characters have Cancer or an illness the book isn't dark  It is actually very joyful and book that could be read over again
One of the best books I've read in a long time Could not stop reading it - the language the characters the storyline just a beautifully written novel
it is really a good noveland i got addicted to it nevertheless I really loved to read Augustus dialogues he is a really a good writer LOVE IS NEVER ILL
This is the first book I have read in a very long time that made me really feel something  Something real and sad and good all at the same time I loved it
I read this because I work with teenage girls and like to see what they are into There were some great parts but I also thought it got bogged down too much
The Fault in Our Stars is a light read about very heavy subjectscancer and love  John Green delicately balances humor and sarcasm throughout this story
What a wonderful story I wanted it to go on and on but unfortunately it had to end The characters stuck in my head long after I completed reading the book
I loved it it was very sad but also uplifting in so many ways  I really thought of the setting the plot the climax andfalling action  I couldn't belive it
Beautiful and sad Powerful and deep There are almost no words to correctly describe this story Heartbreaking but hopeful This is one of my new favorites
I have never read such a sea of emotions The book was fabulous and the movie was great The Fault In Our Stars has changed my experiences of reading forever
Pretty good book but not worth the hype it's been getting Good quick read nothing too complicated but decent insight into someone with a terminal illness
What more is there to say about John Green and his lovely book It was perfectly crafted with an authentic voice Why would anyone dis this sweet little book
Incredible writing To be able to evoke emotion &amp; expand the reader's vocabulary at the same time is a singular gift Thank you John Green Okay Okay Okay
Teen love story made bitter sweet by ongoing battles with a terminal illness You really care about the characters and enjoy watching their journey together
I completed this book in less than 24hrs while on vacationaddictive wonderful read Because of this book I am looking into reading more of Green's work
This book is amazing It is so thoughtful and heart-wrenching It keeps your mind churning and page turning Props to John Green for writing my favorite book
Spectacularly written Good for young adults and not so young adults I found myself wrapped in the love and story between these spectacular young characters
I love it Defiantly recommend reading  I'm  usually into utopian books but this book is really good It's very touching and I could not put the book down
I'm not an avid reader but I saw the previews to the movie and wanted to read the book first I read it start to finish within 4 hours I absolutely loved it
Well written very enjoyable read  Emotional without being too maudlin  It might be one of those rare novels that I will save to read again in a year or so
Literary genius Use of metaphorical language ceased to extend my brain's capacity and tackle the plate which lay before me with scrumptious food for thought
It was an excellent book Not at all depressing and interesting The characters are easy to like and makes you ponder about the important things in this life
Very well written and thought provoking helps fill in questions I had from the movie we meet another character and get to know these 2 heroines a lot better
This is the saddest book I have read in a very long time Keep a box of tissues near you Very well written and unpredictable I can't wait to see the movie
I'm not usually a fan of anything that inspires human emotions but I love John Green so I gave it a go It was beautiful &amp; heartbreaking Be prepared to cry
What a way with words I cried and then I laughed throughout the book The characters were distinctly defined I enjoyed each part of the book and the story
It was a wonderful book had me right from the beginning I hated the ending Although after thinking about it I totally understood why it was done that way
I told myself I wanted to finish reading the book before I watched the movie   I did and I have to say this is probably one of my top five favorite books
This book is great I did not really want to finish the book because I knew that if I finished it then it would be over and I did not want this book to be over
Sad exciting happy maddening Love this book Easy to get swept in since I have went an am going through basically the same thing This is almost my story
Teen angst romantic love and real emotions about living and lives cut short this book has something for everyone I highly and totally recommend this book
I loved this book and I'm nine I would totally recommend this bookIt is soooo awesome also I would totally rate this 5 stars if you don't that is wrong
I saw the movie first Then I bought the book It is the first book I have read that was followed pretty closely in the movie It is a book I will read again
a tragic love storywith a valuable life lessonlive with no regretsa sad but in a strange way upliftingand the fault  IS in our stars
I don't think any book has ever touched  me the way this one has Lots of highlighted sentences here that I will never get tired of reading So so beautiful
All of the allusions were very well placed and it is awesome to see that two fictitious people can intellectually spar and fit together so well with pure wit
This book is short and sweet Very good read The characters in this book were like 60 year old adults trapped inside a 16 year old body and they are funny
It was an beautiful love story filled with the beauty of life The fault dear Brutus is not in our starsBut in ourselves that we are underlings
A classic tale of heroism with many twists that leave the reader wanting more The ending was perfect I loved how it gave Hazel the closure that she needed
The fault in our stars is an amazing well written book It shows true love and what it means to be different and stand out John Green is an amazing author
If you enjoy a good love story and wordy teenagers I highly recommend this book I love how these two verbose teenagers fell in love with each other's minds
Everybody loves a great love story but like all great love stories there's an ending to it Awesome book well written &amp; I would totall recommend this book
this book was interesting from the very start It is about two cancer patients who fall in love which is a unique plot in itself couldn't put the book down

This book was nothing like I expected but it was everything I heard and better I would definitely recommend it Be prepared for the emotional ride though
My teenaged daughter loves this book She has read it several times I have seen her crying a few times while reading it because it is such a touching story

From Grace-Please read this book it was by far one of the best books I have ever read I absolutely love this book and I highly recommend it to all readers
If you like books you will like this one it is remarkable and incredible I've read it many times and I'm glad these fictitious people could be in my life
This is one of the best books I've read this year  No wonder they made a movie based on it  Read the book first then watch the film  You will enjoy both
I think I almost cried like 10 times and don't even let me say how much I highlightedIn conclusion I just want to say pain has to be felt for joy to be felt

This book is so amazing I loved it and could not stop reading John green is an extraordinary writer and I am glad that I had the pleasure of reading his book
This book was full of so much raw emotion so many ignored truths and was just so real Green did an incredible job of capturing life &amp; death &amp; love &amp; loss
Loved the book It was real Could never imagine loosing a child too heartbreaking but you stand strong and try to be their rock even though they are yours
One of my favorite novels ever So much meaning I was highlighting the good phrases Not a big fan realistic fiction Loved this book Read it in three days
Great book  I didn't care for the ending but understand why it ended that way Will watch the movie when it comes out even though the book is always better
Heart warming story of love Read the whole thing in one day I love how she made the personality of Hazel so sassy and funny I very much enjoyed this book
It's a wonderful book For me the secret of the success of the book among women it's the male character He is the boyfriend that every girl wants to have
This book is amazing captures the honesty and the not so pleasant side of cancer that people don't like to admit or acknowledge A great work of literature
There really is only one way to describe the Fault in Our Stars: The most painful beautiful heartbreaking PERFECT book ever written Thank you John Green
Such a great read I couldn't put it down This the first book that I've finished in a very long time The love of these two young people was simply amazing
I laughed out loud and held back tears multiple times I was apprehensive to read another cancer book but this is unlike any other Well done John Green
This was the best book ever and I think that when the person died it was too quick but besides that there could be no better book can't wait to see the movie
They are going to screw up the movie I promise  This cannot be captured in a movie  Love the sarcasm the gallows humor and the teenaged angst of it all
Loved every minute  It was beautifully written with little maudlin sentimentality but honest and true emotion  You feel like you are actually in the book
This book is sweet But fortunately the sweetness is tempered by the realness in Hazel's dialogue ‚Äì both outer and inner I enjoyed it very much
Not what I expected Wonderfully written and easy to read You will require Kleenex or super absorbent paper towels Puts life into perspective A must read
I am not into young teen drama but decided to read it when a friend recommended itThe writing was a little bit obnoxious but the story plot was compelling
Even though I knew this story was not going to end well I simply could not put it down Well written I will read more of John Green's books He has a gift
A very heart touching love storymakes one smilecryfeel blessedsympathizeand makes one realize the world is not a wish granting factory
This is a great book  The characters are entertaining and you feel for them I read the book in two days because I had to find out what was going to happen
beautiful absolutely worth your time this will be among my favorite reads take the time to open your heart to hazel grace and agustus you won't be sorry
I enjoyed this book and think the author captured the reality of being a teenager with cancer I thought the ending with the author was a little far fetched
A story of Love and Joy friendship and sacrifices with everthing that cames with On real lifeBeautiful real teenagers incredible story and caracteres
I liked the book  It was a little hard to get into at first with the quirkiness of the writing but I think that had a lot to do with the teenage characters
this book reads really quickly love the short chapters ideal for long and short commutes it is very engaging once you get into it you can't put it down
This book was nice to read  I expected tears but it was poignant and thoughtful without being a tear-jerker  Now I would like to see the movie
This story was a reminder to me to live in the moment Great read Three generations in my family read this book at the same time and all enjoyed it equally
It was an easy read great story line and characters  A perfect love story for these two cancer patience And perfect to know the movie was (is) coming out
The book is amazing I love the way the author forces us to look at life This is a book that everyone needs to read It is one of the best books on my list
This book is beautifully written between the metaphors and the truth about life John green makes you laugh cry and be mad in this amazing novel please enjoy
A thoughtful read into the feelings of young people and cancer highlighting their feelings and relationships between themselves and the adults who love them
First time I've read a book about terminal illness that did not turn sappy  Good read for anyone  It's not about how long we live it's about really living
It is a very touching and sad story I'm glad that I read it I think that everyone should read this bookbut be prepared to cry and be shocked at the ending
Love story a pretty good one  Movie coming out this week I see  Hope they don't change it too much  Kind of like Love Story movie of the 70's

This was a terrific story Happy sad all wrapped up in one I always like yo read the book before I see the movie to get the storyline This is a must read
This book was awesome  Most people might think it is about fighting cancer but it is truly about our quest as humans to find true meaningful love Amazing

I actually cried It's such a touching story filled with soft humour I would definitely recommend this book and its understandable why it's a #1 bestseller
I thought the story was a bit cliche and very expected those thoughts aside tho it's still a good read and I cried when certain people passed overall B-
Easy read but enthralling and full of really great quotes and deep thoughts that get you thinking about not only the story but about the meaning it portrays
Wonderfully delightful sadnessI have never enjoyed crying so much  What a treasure to have a book portray teenagers as thinking beings Very well done

Loved this book  Was hesitant to take it on vacation given the subject matter  But it was thoroughly entertaining and even rather funny  Beautiful story
A book on such a serious topic that can make you laugh and smile on one page and dissolve to tears the next  Vividly written I didn't want to put it down
Excellent book I definitely recommend reading it it is WORTH IT Great storyline and mix of both humor and romance Do yourself a favor and read this book

Beautiful storyBeautiful writingBeautiful charactersA book for all ages - I don't care who you are you'll love it and learn from it
I liked that it was emotional and real I would probably recommend this more for a younger audience Some of it seemed a little far fetched but overall good
I thoroughly enjoyed reading this book I was surprised at how funny some parts were given the context of the book All-around an entertaining quick read
I enjoyed this story and how well John Green expressed the thoughts and feeling of his characters I immediately upon finishing ordered Looking for Alaska
This is a great story Pretty well written great characters not too many predictable plot moments Definitely a tear-jerker  I will read it again someday
I am so mad at John green right now I am hiding in the bathroom to hide how much the final euology made me bawl This happened the first time i read it too
It is a five but too young for me Even older grumps should read this Even ones who have done their own caregiving and buried their loves Very thoughtful
As a mother who last a child to illness this book was enlightening  I miss her dearly I love you baby girl I believe you can fly Until I see you again
Is it acceptable to use quotes when my own words don't feel adequate I fell in love the way you would fall asleep: slowly then all at once
It's sad guys It's a story about kids with cancer could you believe it would end well Despite that it is a wonderful read Looking forward to the movie
I have  no words to describe this  book It is simply amazing Even though it will leave  you in tears and feeling quite depressed this book is a must read
Absolutely worth recommending and rereading  It was heartbreakingly beautiful and extremely well written  I can only hope the movie does this book justice
2 Thumbs up Heartwrenching and movingThis will be one you cannot put downYou will thank your lucky stars for each day of having good health
I never thought a book could change your life no matter how sappy it feels Thank you John  and I would recommend this book to everyone who comes across it
I loved this book so much my emotions were going crazy during this book happy and sad Way to go john I am very impressed and I would recommend it to anyone
It was simply Impeccable OkayThey say fifteen more words are required to post the review Kinda silly It doesn't need fifteen Only five
this book was so good one should defiantly read this book it is 12:34 in the morning and I have school tomorrow but this book is so good I can't put it down
such a great book I want to read it again and again I will and I'll cry the same tears I did in the same spot and love it like the first time I've read it
I liked how the book was from the cancer patient's perspective I found it to be encouraging the courage these young people display everyday that they live
This book was excellent I loved every page and how you can picture the characters I probably won't see the movie because I don't want it to ruin the book
I really enjoyed this book Fast paced and engaging but also moving I would recommend this to Alonso anyone (except maybe a parent of a child with cancer)
If anybody loves meaningful books this is it This book made me cry on more than one occasion but it really stays with you the true meaning of this story
This book is one of the best books I have ever read in my life Wouldn't recommend for children ages 9 and under Be ready to cry I LOVE FAULT IN OUR STARS
well written captured the heart intensely good perspective on life and love made me stop and remember what it was that inspired me all the little things
Absolutely amazing I sobbed and laughed and mostly sobbed This world is such a cruel place but I am grateful for the time my 14 people got to spend on it
So innocent funny real and sad So glad our book club chose itwonderful read I will miss hazel Grace Looking forward to reading another John green book
Interesting entertaining and extremely heartfelt  I really felt for the characters and could not stop reading always wondering how their stories would end
Amazing book has something for everyone  Makes you really feel for cancer patients and survivors  If you're hesitating don't  You won't be disappointed
Amazing Book  Even a year later I still think about it from time to time  Everyone I know that read it loves it too  Beautiful and inspiring characters
Cried like a BabyIt was awesome I was hooked the whole timeI'm a college student so I don't have much free time but I read it in less than a week
This is a great story in general and I enjoyed it But I was not a literary classic  I found the characters to be predictable  Still liked the story line
Interesting style character development &amp; plot twists  Nice love story &amp; coming of age too  The author is quirky--his writing reflects it but I liked it
Such a great read I couldn't put it down  You may think its juvenile because its about teenagers but you are wrong  Such a heartwarming and telling story
I absolutely hated this book  This had to be the most depressing book I've ever read  I just don't care to read books that make me want to commit suicide
Ok most books can't make me cry but wow This book is amazing It's so good This is NOT a waste of money OMYGOSH IT'S SO GOOOD John Green is amazing
This is an excellent read  It is not my usual type of book at all so I am a tough customer  It does deserve all of the good reviews that it has received
I wish it kept on going it had me crying in the by the end  I wish I could read Augustus read the eulogy at Hazel's funeral But it was good nonetheless
The featured 4 books butt dialed and ordered with no refund - yep I always hate paying for something I didn't order - Kindle genius marketing scam
Amazingly written I would recommend it to the world Really opens your eyes to what others could be going through while still trying to be some else's joy
Beautifully written and an easy read Brought tears to my eyes as I remembered my own loss Beautiful and painful reminder of the reality of life and death
I wanted to see the movie and I m one of those people that have to read the book before seeing the movie I won't see the movie because the book is perfect
This is an absolutely wonder book that shows the devastating effects of illness and how some people deal with it I read it in 4 hours and had to finish it
Five stars it is a really good book I recommend this book to anyone who likes romance I think this book has a lot of detail the is what I like about it
I LOVED THIS BOOKbut it was so so sadSpoiler AlertAugustus diesOn the bright sidethe other main characters live#Awesome Sauce Loved the book

Very powerful look into life with and death by terminal illness Remember that thing you keep putting off This book might just kick your butt to get to it
The book didn't climax until more than half way through The story seemed a bit boring in the beginning but really brought it home in the end Decent read
Incredibly well written and a total tear jerker A beautiful love story between two young old souls who were meant to be together in this life and the next
I loved this book It gives the reader a window into a world I hope to never enter I laughed cried and cried some more This book will touch many and all
Touching Excellent questions posed with some answers givenbut not all And I appreciated that Recommend highly to anyone looking for a meaningful read
This is an excellent book Once you start residing you don't want to pour it down There Are times of laughter and times of crying A wonderful love story
it was so beautifully written it was a sad story written with a glimmer of happiness I would suggest this book to everyone I can't wait to see the movie
Wonderful writing inspires deep thinking Looking at life through new perspectives The book takes a sad subject and weaves the story until peace is found
Beautifully written Tragically comforting and heartwarming Sad and uplifting Bravo Mr Green A novel for the sick the grieving and everyone in between
Beautifully written Hazel Grace is so likable wanted more like Hazel had longed for in the novel she loved but yet thought it ended where it should have
I'm only 11 years old and I read this book it was intense and really good I will tell you it is not for young readers the book swears and has a drunk in it
This book was smartly written Although the reality of cancer is grim this book takes the raw honesty of the disease and turns it into something beautiful
This book is so good I recommend this because there's happiness sadness akwardness and romance My favorite book by far In life Buy this book y'all
This threw me right back into what a budding romance at that age feels likeand then it tore all of the happy away and made me cry and then cry some more
An interesting perspective on the ravages of cancer from the viewpoint of a very unique teenage girl Written beautifully I hope it is followed by another
This book is amazing It captures the element of romance while keeping it believable Unless you have a heart of stone you will cry at the end of this book
Great story just wish language and premarital sex wasn't needed for it His other books are worse I know but this one was sweet and liked the movie as well
Really great book  I definitely enjoyed reading it  It's a quick read somewhat heartbreaking but still sort of uplifting  Read it you won't regret it
lovely story of young love told with humor affection and realism  cancer does not stop falling in love  it just makes dying bittersweet for the survivor
This is one beautifully written book about young people dealing with cancer and how they lived theirlives with pain and have the strength to carry on
This is a very heart warming yet very sad story but one that happens everyday  Easy to read but well written I very interesting twist to an age old story
the book is so broken down so can feel that this book is heart felt and took time for John green to study it and make sure it was good enough for the world
love love love this book was definitely worth the buy i cried more times than id like to admit lol this book definitely restored my faith in good books
At first I thought it was another teenager love story but it grabbed me and the characters became real to me as all good characters do I'll miss Augustus
Green tackles difficult subjects adeptly with humor and compassion  His character development is outstanding One of the best books I'have read in a while
Finally a book that doesn't make adolescents pitiful but powerful A book for all ages to read and learn to sit back tread lightly and leave less scars
This isn't a story about death but instead how to live your life as if it were near the end Likeable characters who aren't perfect but truly live and love
What does living mean to you How would your life change if you had a fatal disease A wonderful book well worth the read Be prepared for cathartic crying
I have read and re-read this book I never get tired of it It will make you cry and fall in love with the characters This is my all time favorite book
I wanted to read the book before I saw the movie It was a quick read and entertaining I won't go out of my way to read all his books but I enjoyed this
Read this on the recommendation of a friend's daughter Loved the intelligent caring relationships depicted in this book as well the dialogues Great work
This is an excellent book I have recommended this book to several other people The previews for the movie looked good so I decided to read the book first
I loved this book I Felt like it was perfectly clear to the audience about everything that happened It made me see a different side of what life was about
I enjoyed this book from the first page It is well written and informative I especially enjoy having Whispersync so that I can listen while taking walks
This book had a different love story that made you realize what it is like to truly love someone even when you know the future outcome of that persons life
Best book I've read yet  A captivating story from the first words to the very last  Heart wrenching yet heart warming epic love story of a short infinity
I think this book has a beautiful meaning and moral but I didn't like it kind of dragged on at the end before she finds the letters written by her true love
Excellent book  Can't wait to see the movie  I wonder if there will be a sequel to see how Hazel Grace fairs toward the end and how her parents handle it
Very we'll placed  Very alive  In depth  Heartwarming and soul sourcing  A lot of questions asked how would I respond as a parent sibling daughter friend
Like the narrative And funny parts of the story   it teach people to look outside the Windows based on What you want to see not What others ask you to see
As I read this book it was very sad but opened a lot of space  in my heart for cancer  Cancer is only a death sentence if you let it be Be prepared to cry
so sad but so good I could not get my head out of this book The love story just added to the suspense I think Gus and Hazel are the best part of the book
It has been many years since words have caused tears to stream down my face only to be thrown off course by laughter found on the next page Wonderful read
Even though I knew what was coming I want prepared for it This book grabbed from the first page and didn't let go yet I will remember this story forever
It was a great book I would definitely recommend this book to anyone who loves these kinds of stories I love how it is a romantic story about teenagers
This book will leave you speechless and wanting more but knowing there isn't more A perfect sweet love story with life as the betrayer Perfectly beautiful
Absolutely touching  A wonderfully written heartfelt and witty story  Excited to see the movie hopefully the movie follows the book  I highly recommend
I love the way John Green writes A very sad book that made me feel so guilty for laughingI belted this one out in one day; I couldn't put it down
Great story about love sickness family and finding your own meaning in life It dives into making a name for yourself that will last even after your gone
Great book and I love the whispersinc to have the book on my kindle for reading in bed at night and the audio from audible to listen to during my commute
Read this book before seeing the movie loved both Some say god characters are unrealistic but remember it is fiction and not reporting and it's all good
This is a great book a love story and a story of death and aftermath I an excited to see the movie and see if books by this author are as good as this one
The love shown in this book is amazing You will fall in love with every character I fell in love with him like you fall asleep: slowly but all at once
This is the best book that I have ever read I've read many books Trust me This touched my heart I couldn't put it down Well done John Green Well done
I loved this nontraditional love story It was a real-life tragic romance that kept my attention I recommend it to anyone wanting an excellent quick read
I absolutely loved and hated this book at the same time It was heart wrenching in the best possible way A book like this is the reason why I love to read

What a gorgeous and heartbreaking story Green has a lovely writing style I enjoyed every page Highly recommended but not for readers under perhaps 13
This book is a unique take on teens facing fatal diseases  The fresh perspective of the teens featured and the real emotions make this a great read for me
I was very moved by these characters Althought they are my children's age I connected with them because I'm a cancer survivor I cannot wait for the movie
A masterpiece This book is a great tale of the tragic love story of two magnificent (and relatable) characters who make you cry and laugh at the same time
This book has a little bit of everything It was a perfect blend of love adventure and tragedy It was very moving and kept me interested til the very end

I LOVE THE FAULT IN OUR STARS ONE OF THE BEST BOOKS I HAVE EVER READ JOHN GREEN IS AND AMAZING AUTHOR AND I THANK HIM FOR WRITTING THE FAULT IN OUR STARS
This was a very good book  It taught me a lot about cancer and the feelings associated with it It was fast reading yet challenging for me (middle school)
All I feel is pain My heart hurts I can't stop crying this is one of the most amazingly messed up books I have ever had the pleasure and fortune to read
Okay my nieces LOVE this book I may not be the target audience Well written interesting  characters Just very predictable if you are over the age of 20
Green's superb writing makes you feel as if you are part of this amazing love story I read the entire book in one afternoon because I couldn't put it down
This book is outstanding I loved and savored every minute of this book I will recommend this to many friends This book is a must read for any book lover
John Greene didn't try and make it a fairy tale ending As he put it the world is not a wish granting factory and he didn't make it seem that way
This book is raw honest and the story is beautiful The perspective the author brings is fresh and original and it's a read that will be hard to put down
I realy liked this book and especially the two main characters: Hazel Grace and Augustus Waters that you really cared for and were so brave and admirable
Absolutely amazing Heart felt and funny you don't forget it It changes how you see lifewhat life looks like from the perspective of those who are sick
This was a great quick read and the book was perfect  John Green really let the characters come alive with his vivid imagery  I would highly recommend it
Good quick story of a view of the inside life of teenagers dealing with cancer Recommend if you are looking for something easy and don't mind a few tears
The story draws you in from the beginning I couldn't put it down I am so glad I listened to the person who recommended this book I was sad to see it end
I liked this book  It was well-written and very poignant  The story was a bit predictable but hey it's a young adult novel  It is a tear jerker though
Spoiler freeThis book took my mind &amp; threw it and my entire self into an emotional roller coasterThe day that I received it I became so absorbed in the book after reading just two chapters I couldn't resist the idea of reading more later on When it came night I picked it up again &amp; then proceeded to stay up the entire night reading the whole thing for about a total of six hours I smiled I cried and I felt the emotions of the characters I wish I hadn't read it so fast because it was so good but I plan to read it again soonI recently rediscovered my love for reading &amp; this was the first book that I picked up from my order It was great &amp; I highly recommend it if you just want to read a good book with a good storyAlso the 'Review' quotes sum it up perfectly as well I advise you to buy this book Now
A couple of years ago I went to my local library and picked up a copy of John Green's 'Looking for Alaska' Soon after I found out that John had written more novels and went to read them too They were very well written and inspiring When I heard that John was writing another book I pre-ordered it without hesitation I did not regret that The Fault in Our Stars is a superb and thoughtful book that I would recommend to anyone The messages that the book brings across are strong and poignant and they're something that we can all relate to This book gave me a new perspective on life and the world that we live in The Fault in Our Stars was the first book that I've read in a while to make me laugh cry and examine the world for a different standard I definitely recommend this book to anyone and I wouldn't say that about any book so please give it a read
Loved it because the book describes the life of a sick person in a true and honest way Not bubble-wrapped but extremely beautiful and for sure emotional
Incredibly emotional moving and inspiring read  Drew me in almost immediately  I haven't cried over a book like that since I was a teenager  Loved it
The characters are so beautifully developed throughout the entire story John Green is an absolute genus for writing this book in the brilliant way he did
Teen tear-jerker but well written and entertaining and a good read even if you are an old guy who doesn't generally like to read books that make you cry
Absolutely beautiful story and incredibly written  I laughed cried got angry and it made take a different look at my ambitions and life  Just loved it
I work in the library and when the movie came out all of our books were either checkedout or on holds by 30 other people So I came to amazon to order it
Even without all the movie hype I guessed the ending at about page 10 The writing was good otherwise just a little heavy in the foreshadowing  department
I enjoyed the freshness Interesting characters Realistic story Believable romance Tear jerker Good story line I would read more books by this author
I really like this book I recommend this for my aunt and I liked it because it made me feel like stay strong and don't give up good job John Green good job
Deep and difficult teen romance battles the difficulties of existing with cancer The book is emotional and teary but still entertaining and heartlifting
I loved every single page I am a Spanish literature major and from a professional opinion there are no words to describe the literary beauty in the book
Why this is marketed as young adult is beyond me This book and The Book Thief are two of the best books I 've read (and I read a lot)
Beautifully written I somehow felt connected to the characters and their struggles Really makes you appreciate each day and live a life filled with love
Amazingly enough this book actually is worth reading I surprised myself by enjoying it thoroughlyWell written minimally sappy an engaging story
A sad story well written nicely told  I liked the depth of the characters Hard to believe they were only teenagers but illness can mature one rapidly
I thought it was beautifully written  Although heartbreaking not over bearing  Have a box of tissues nearby  I now want to read another by this auther
I cried so much near the end  of this book this book  is also very touching runaway that lets the reader feel how Gus or hazel feels living with the cancer
This book is a great read I prefer to read a book if I want to see the movie After reading it I am sure I work be disappointed by the movie as usual
I didnt enjoy this book as much as I thought I would I didnt find the story line very believable and the main character wasnt very likeable in my opinion
It's impossible not to fall in love with the characters in this book Beautifully written It captivates you until the very end Buy this book and read it
Impeccably writtenHilarious tragic and philosophicalUnlike anything I have ever read  A must-read (that must be read with a box of tissues handy)
Incredible book Augustus note were so powerful and mesmerizing I'm glad I've read this book Gosh Amazing how can one Not love The idea of Love at least
I am so glad I finally decided to read this book It lived up to all the hype What a beautiful tragic story I would recommend it to anyone and everyone
Sweet love story between two terminal teenagers  Story told with warmth and humor yet shows the harsh reality of their mortality with dignity and respect
This was the most enjoyable book I've read in a long time Made me think of the meaning of life death love and connections to people earth and universe
This book made me laugh cry smile frown you name it It was so amazing and it played with my emotions the whole time I saw the movie to Just as good
Well written book with nice characters A little too much teenage stuff for me The topic of two teens having cancer was done well No tear jerking scenes
A very quick read Although it was sad I enjoyed it a lot I laughed and cried  It wasn't what I expected I do wish there was a little more of an ending
now to see the movie  People said no one teenager spoke like Hazel and Gusbut the author convinces us that these two DO speak like young adults
Chose 5 stars because of the heart warming and heart wrenching that occurred throughout the novelI love the emotions that were touched by this book
Such an amazing and beautiful love story I could not put it down One I will always remember--Hazel and Gus will not be forgotten  A definite must- read
It's an awesome book It's a nice romantic book  nothing like those typical books John Green made this book for people to see that there is always beauty
Keep a box of tissue by your side at all times The story is a well written journey of joys and sorrows It will keep your attention from beginning to end
This was a love story every one should read It was everything rolled into one All I have so say is if you don't read it you will never know a great book
Very inspiring I don't usually read this type of book but I must say it was a great story  Way to go John Green I hope the movie is as good as the book
Great portrayal of adolescent cancer From someone has been through this experience I appreciate reading a real story of it and not a romanticized version
No Spoilers here--A nice little read   A refreshing look and attitude at an unfortunate situationThe story has definite life value
To review a book of this magnitude would be an injustice  Suffice to say it is a most meaningful and moving approach to life and it's Subsequent extremes
Raises all kinds of great questions for (pre) teenagers (and their parents) about who owes what to whom  who cares for whom  Reading it with my daughter
Another great story from John Green great imagination great descriptive words that imagery was through out the whole story and never let the reader down
The Fault In Our Stars is such a GREAT BOOKI am going to want to read it over and over again I DEFINITELY RECOMMEND OTHER PEOPLE READ THIS
Brilliantly written Couldn't put the book down I wanted to read the book before seeing the movie Sure glad I did John Green just got himself a new fan
John Green makes you fully aware of the feelings of the characters in this book You can't help but root for and fall in love with everyone you read about
Despite it being a total chick flick it was very good read it in a day don't deny yourself the  privilege of reading this book just cause your a guy
this is a quick read only two days  I found it to definitely written for young adults  it is well written  I hope to see the movie soon anxious to see
I read this book twice in 2 days Wonderfully written beautiful love story Can't stop thinking about it  Get ready to cry but it's a good cry I promise
I really like this book because it is kinda like real-life in a way if you have cancer or not I read this book in 2 days because it was so well written
Absolutely loved it Satirical yet serious with an unexpected ending If you're on the fence about buying it I suggest that you do it is worth the money
I couldn't put the book down for one second I became attached to each character both large and small The love of Gus and Hazel will live on for eternity
I did not care for it I was very disappointed I saw the movie advertises and thought I'd read the book before the movie Now I won't be seeing the movie
It's just a great book and teaches so many valuable lessons People the world is hard to live in but the people with cancer suffer more than anyone else
I know everyone is in love with this book but not one positive thing happened in the entire book Several characters and NOTHING positive with any of them
This is my favorite book of all time It was the perfect mixture of love and tragedy It questioned life while it gave life meaning Well done Phenomenal
This was a great read Made me cry but in a good way if that makes sense for this kind of book Makes you appreciate the charactersand I really liked them
Very nice and different    I loved the relation of constellations and thoughts  I have read this novel nine times and still am not bored of hazel and Gus
John Greene's novel is a wonderful tale of pain and loss that leaves behind the usual sentimental hopefulness and instead focuses on personhood and reality
written beautifully the author did a great job portraying the thoughts of someone battling cancer an easy read page turner and feel good/feel sad novel
Loved it It was a great book and having 2 family members who are cancer survivors made it even more real Can't wait to see the movie when it is released
I really enjoyed this book I am having a hard time picking a book to read next because I feel like it will be a let down in comparison to this little gem
Very honest and a great read Finished it the day I bought it Seems pretty spot on to the movie previews Takes unexpected turns and a true tear jerker
Loved the story Great read for late teens/ early 20's Nice to have author from so close Looking forward to seeing what the movie does to the story line
I liked it a lot and really was sucked Into the characters point of view I definitely would read more of Jhon Greens booksREAD THIS BOOK
I thought this book was very well written and I absolutely enjoyed the relationship between hazel and Gus I also enjoyed the moments that I could relate to
I initially thought this would be an adolescent read and ignored it But once I started I couldn't stop You would start loving the way hazel is portrayed
This book was pretty good I got pretty emotional over it and I always love a good book that can make you cry Can't wait to see this turned into a movie
The battle of love and disease Great book tears were shed at the end love story humorous sad what more could of been added to this book It was great
Omg this is the best book EVER it is the perfect love story with a huge twist  I couldn't help but read it over and over again  Can't wait for the movie
A little slow moving for me Well written but didn't pull at my heartstrings the way I was expecting Not a bad book but I was looking for a page turner
A well written story full of wit and wise words Enjoyed it Quick read Would recommend it to anyone really especially anyone who takes life for granted
This book was amazing and I couldn't stop reading John green ended the book so perfectly I cried myself to sleep Thank you for writing a wonderful novel
This should be required reading for middle and high school students  Buy it in Audible and play it so they will listen and appreciate how fragile life is
It was fantastic It made me cry a lot but not for long it is a bitter sweet book with some comedy thrown in and it is now my hands-down top favorite book
TFIOS is a compelling harrowing and inspiring story Uplifting yet sad Everyone ten years old and up should be made to read it they will never look back
Great book - takes you through so many emotions and instantly draws the reader into their lives A beautiful and touching love story Definitely recommend
Awesome book about life and death Very well written tons of intelligent thoughts Highly recommended for anyone looking for a romantic sentimental novel
absolutely and underlay amazing you need to read this book it will definitely pull on your heart strings and make you look at this world a whole new way
This book was so beautiful and sad to think of what cancer patients go through People who have cancer are so strong and brave this story is inpirational
AMAZING Simply amazing The characters and events blended together in pure harmony creating an unforgettable love story for every kind of person to read
What to say that hasn't been said While not as good as Looking for Alaska in my opinion it is still absolutely incredible and left me in buckets of tears
I read the whole thing in like four sittings (when I had the time) Clever I'd recommend it to my friends It's emotional and very sarcastic Great read
The fault in our stares  is a epic romance novel it contains amazing metaphors and beautiful poetry This book is truely amazing i love this amazing book
This book was funny and sad and beautiful all at the same time  I loved it John green has a way with words and I saw a movie is to be released June 2014
This book was beyond beautiful I stayed up till 4 am to finish it This book is one of the best books I've read and can't wait until the movie comes out
The best book by John Green yet Much more than a YA read this could easily be read and discussed in contemporary literature classes  Recommend to all
It was really relatable to the average teenager with fun easy to follow pop culture references  I'd recommend this book to any tragedy and romance lovers
It passed the time Heartwarming and bittersweet Yes written for a teenage audience but this 34 year old still enjoyed it albeit trite in a few areas
this book helps to reflect on the way you should be living your life it makes you wanted to live by being loved by others and appreciate all that you have
Well I read the book in about 9 total hours in two days and it was an amazing experience other than the fact that I am now swimming in a pool of depression
This book has opened my eyes as a teenager The words used in this book are phenomenological I will for ever keep this book and share it with my children
The Fault In Our Stars was a metaphorical book consisting of love humor and cancer I applaud John Green for one of his greatest and most touching books
While the subject matter is challenging the very real conversation and teenage attitude are beautifully done  A completely different coming-of-age story
This is a wonderful book although the dialogue between the characters do not sound like teenagers I would recommend this book to anybody and everybody (:
Wonderful insight into how fragile life really is  I could not put it down  Teenagers should have to read it to get more appreciation for a healthy life
I :( this was a wonderful book to read MrGreen I don't know what to do nowI cried She cried He cried We all cried can't wait for the movie
After just witnessing my grandfather loose his battle with cancer I found myself crying a lot and making many connections with the characters in the book
Highly Recommended  This book was very touching  I read it in two days and then read it again  Warning: You will also need to purchase a box of tissues
I am not a big reader and read this book for work but can't put it down It's a great story and definitely gets the reader and their emotions to come out
I would recommend this book So much emotion and love It was heartbreaking but also heartwarming It shows the other side of a horrible thing like cancer
A great book about the strength of love the human character and what it means to be a friend I highly recommend this book as well as Looking for Alaska
This is the perfect book in my opinion It's beautifully written poignant thoughtful funny (at times) relatable and (most importantly) so so very honest John Green paints a world that you feel apart ofwhere you cheer on Hazel's victories and you cry with her during her losses It's a book about falling in love that actually makes you fall in love; with the characters with the writing with the plot and with so many of those tiny quotable nuggets that you find yourself carrying around with you even after you've put the book down I had been told to read TFIOS since it came out and I'm upset that it took me as long as it did to finally pick it up I finished it within 4 days (it would've been 1 but I'm a full-time student hah) While it's technically a 'young adult' novel anyone can relate to it I cannot praise this book highly enough
I read this book after it was really popular I see why so many people liked it The love story was really cute and I think the ending is very well done
I did not see the movie before reading the book I wonder now if I should have The book was a disappointment It was boring and hard to follow sometimes
I loved this book so much It has such a beautiful story I cried so much and it was so worth it I thing everyone should read this book  üòäüéÜüéÜüòçüíû
i'm a girl who absolutly loves to read i have read many books and by far this is my favorite i have read this book about 50 times but it never gets old
Loved this bookmuch different than movie It looks into the soul and takes a raw look into the things we are afraid to talk about and say about cancer
I laughed; I criedwell mostly I cried This is a great book by a great author It's almost as good as Looking for Alaska which is high praise indeed
Changes beliefs and views makes your heart feel like Hazels lungs A must read and a must share Especially for those who have someone who died of cancer
I guess I was hoping for better this having a movie made based on itI was just okay I may feel differently if I was facing these struggles myself
I watched the movie first I did seem to like the movie better but the book is still a great book It's very heartbreaking yet wonderful at the same time
Even as an adult that originally had no interest in a teen story I feel like a better person for reading it and falling in love with Hazel and Augustus
AMAZINGLove this book soooooo muchOMG TWIST ENDINGFIVE STARS BY FARBEST BOOK EVERLOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE
Good story well written for the teen market and a easy read for adults  John Green is a great writer and this further cements his storytelling abilities
Even though it is unbearably sad its well-written and poignant plot will keep you reading well into the nightBravo John Green for a wonderful gem
This book was the best book everüòçüòçüòçüòçüòçüòçüòçüòçüòçüòçüòçüòçüòçüòçüòçüòçüòçüòçüòçüòçüòçI love it more than lifeCouldn't be anymore happy with the author
Powerful storyline with no sugar coating You fall in love with each and then end will touch your heart in such an extreme way I loved this book so much
The book made you feel like you were there and witnessing the conversations of the characters You fall in love with the characters and cry when they cry
It was so beautiful I'm in love lol but I don't see way was really sad I mean ppl were virgin over it but I don't know why it's heart warming and cute tho
An easy read with witty humor and banter Makes you long for true love and companionship And opens your mind to being honest with yourself and the world
I enjoyed the book and wish I had such a simplistic outlook of the world in which we live  I'd like to appreciate this life as much as the characters do
Absolutely loved the book  Being surrounded by teenagers I am all to familiar with how deeply emotional they are and we have no real drama to deal with
My sister lives with brain cancer every day Sometimes we sit back in the numb comfort of the unknown This book and this author captures what that means
It was good  Easy to read  Made me realize how books are sometimes written like the words young people speak now  Looking forward to watching the movie
this is my first romace book and i dont think that i will read another again any time soon But i think that its a good read and its worth anyones time
Sweet sad story This book is what I expected it to be I did know the ending before I read the book It was a quick read and the writing was very good
Couldn't put it down Green weaves am enchanting tale that reveals that our best hopes for significance are realised in the simple act of being ourselves
Good story I see why it was turned into a movie Juvenile read so don't go in expecting sophisticated writing Some thought provoking moments Enjoyable
It's amazing how simple lives are but when they touch each other and disease makes choices for them it's even harder to understand why we are alive at all
This book is a tear jerkerüò•üò• I definitely will be reading it again and getting the paperback This book is worth your time and the writing is wonderful
I read this book because I heard about it on the Today Show  Glad I read it but would not haveI know it is a movie but I'm not a movie goer
Good and easy read kept me wanting to continue reading the book as each chapter passed I wish i knew what happened to Hazel I will now watch the movie
I loved everything about this bookexcept that it ended too soon  I loved the realness of the charactersthey made me laugh and cry at the same time
I Loved the storm it touched my heart greatly It is a love story worth reading so good and real most would want the novel to be based on a true story
I loved it Even after seeing lot of adds for the movie there where some things that were unexpected  Need a lot of tissues with some laughter added in
This book it great I would recommend it It is sad but has great meaning From someone who has survived cancer it makes me have a different perspective
I would give this audiobook 10 stars if they were available The book is fabulous but the reader makes it even better with her inflections while reading
What a great story about life and lovethe true meanings of life  and loveloved this book an would recommend it to anyoneteens or oldergreat story
Not what I expected Hazel Grace is a very brave young women faced with things we all fear but she still lived loved and had compassion truly remarkable
green has taken an ugly disease and made us understand it's complexities you truly feel how thinks cannot be left undone Loving and leaving way of life
This book was amazing Read it before you see the movie You will need some tissues I teared up multiple times but I willnever regret reading this book
Touching without being cliche silly or a cancer book Great relationships throughout A very enjoyable book John Green is a fantastic author
This book deserves all the popularity it has gotten  It is a warm sensitive story sure to touch your heart  And not as predictable as you would think
This book has undoubtedly become my favorite of favorites To read this book was as if I was able to experience falling in love for the first time again
One night readi thought it was just amazing Can't wait to see the movie nowhopefully it is not disappointing because of how great the book was
An amazing book that touches on the impact of cancer on its 2 main characters Beautifully written story that embraces the resiliency of the human spirit
My God it was amazing No spoilers but what a truly beautiful book More realistic than other teen romance books but still a real heartbreak of a novel
I have  never read  a better love story that explains how precious  life is It is an amazing book and I highly recommend it to anyone willing to read it
The Fault in our Stars is a pure love story and  everybody should read this book before they watch the movie of this romantic comedy and tempting novel
I loved the way this love story unfolded The parents of both Augustus and Hazel were my heroes John Green made it impossible for me to put the book down
I sure hope the movie lives up to the book You can't help but wonder about the rest of Hazel's life' just like Van Houten's book referenced in this book
I loved this book and received it promptly in the mail It is definitely one of a kind book that tries to show cancer through an adolescent's perspective
I read this book because someone I only heard about is in the movie  It makes you think about how we are all so much alike whether we are healthy or not
What an inspiring testament on life  These characters were dying but they knew how to live be loved and be friends  Shouldn't we all be so very lucky
Adore This BookOne of only a few I will re-read over and overVery descriptive Such astonishing beauty in the character and their words
I held my breath a lot while reading Not for what was going to happen next but in wishing for a better outcome than what was coming But it was beautiful
I really enjoyed reading this book I couldn't put it down I liked the characters they were real and could relate I will recommend this book to everyone
This book is unbelievable Could not it it down Heartbreaking but triumphant Beautiful beautiful  love story I want to read  every  book of his now
I love itMakes you think about how much time we have on this earth and how we should use it wisely and if we don't no one will remember in 100 years
This is the best and most freaking sad book I have ever read This will be passed on for generations and then some  God help me I love this book üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠
Preparing to see the movie version of this book with a granddaughter I read the book upon her recommendation I have been touched and given hope as well
This story warms my heart I cried every moment I couldn't believe Augustus had died The best part was at the very beginning when Hazel meets Augustus
I could not put this book down the last few chapters read through teary eyes it has been quite some time since I've read a book that I felt this deeply
This book was absolutely amazing It has you hooked from the very beginning  The way the author writes makes you completely understand how they feel
I loved this book it was funnysad and very heartwarmingwe must keep our sense of humor when we face difficulties in lifeand this book did just that
Great story Well written Would highly recommend this book to anyone I saw previews for the movie today on television Already got a date night planned
This book is amazing I couldn't put it down I am super excited for the movie to come out I highly recommend this book You will laugh and you will cry
Oh my god i loved it so great for the teenage generation I would read it again Cant wait to see the movie as i finished the book i seen the commercial
This is a sad and touching book I cried a lot because my grandfather passed away with cancer I loved this sad book I felt very sad about what happened
Simply amazing I've never cried so much reading a book This is not just for young adults Adults of any age will enjoy it I highly recommend this book
Thought this was a very good story although quite depressing  Another view on life that I had not seen  Thought the characters were all well thought of
I have only cried twice while reading a book and I am an avid reader I cried so hard while reading this book It is the best book I have ever read Ever
I loved everything about this book and read nearly all of it in one sitting It was so sad and touching A perfectly wrappedpackage of love and loss

everyone read cannot put into words my love for Hazel and Gus cancer is merely a disease fighting to be alive my prayers goes out to everyone affected
simply awestruck by this amazing book I am so lucky as to of been put in the eyes of someone like Hazel to see the world as she sees it is breathtaking
Makes you appreciate lifeSo damn sad thoughCouldn't stop crying felt like a family member diedWould read it again
A romance about teenagers which is somehow more sophisticated than most non-YA novels Philosophical without being pretentious Sweet without being sappy
This book is amazing I can't explain This book made me smile laugh and cry I was balling at the end I recommend this book published a good love story
This is the first book I have read in years Excellent book - powerful - moving - REAL Looking forward to reading more books in the future by John Green
This book was amazing The way it made you fall in love with the characters and feel the same feelings as Hazel was beautiful but brutal at the same time
I am so glad I read this book which is out of my box  I loved Hazel and Augustus' relationship  They complemented each other  So much to think about
Very sensitive topic children with cancerBeautiful narrative and places description make us want for moreCongratulations Mr GreenBen
people know me as heartless but when I read this book I could relate to it so much that I cried I couldn't stop crying It's romantic and simply amazing
This was a beautiful story Couldn't put it down But definitely needed a tissue or two before I was done reading it (who am I kidding I used a whole box)
This book will fill you with hope and then take it all away it will make you laugh and make you sob The Fault in Our Stars is a great read for all ages
Could not have loved it any more than I did It was amazing I fell in love with both Augustus and Hazel Everyone should read it DFTBA wooo john green

I absolutely love this book and the meaning and feelings expressed throughout the book Well written John Green  thanks for making my life so much better
I have been on a reading slump for almost a year and thus was the first book I have read  Great story about a very sad life  I am ready to read another
I wouldn't give this book five stars because I didn't like how the ending was I wanted her to find the note of course but I wish there  was a little more
This book was goodsome of it was kookier than I amyet it was cleverthoughtful and full of raw emotionLove knows no boundariesespecially in this book
This book left me bawling my eyes out and speechless I couldn't think clearly until I had sat back and cried for a good thirty minutes And let me just say i'm not usually a crier when it comes to books This story really opened my eyes to the terrible diseases people really have and made me think about life in a different way I'm having a really hard time writing this review because there are just no words to describe how brilliant it wasI felt so connected to the characters and by the end of the book John Green had me convinced Hazel and Augustus were real people and i was a part of their beautiful heart-wrenching tragedy I loved the ending and how Green left Hazel's story hanging for us to finish for ourselves I think we were all meant to follow the lead of Augustus Waters and write our own epiloguesI know I have
Absolutely loved reading this book The characters were rich in emotion personality strength weakness and so honest Must read more from this author
I loved this book  It's uplifting thought-filled and shows how resilient people of all ages can be when faced with challenges  I recommend this book
A marvelous book that tackles a difficult subject with wit and clarityno sappy melodrama to cheapen what these endearing characters are going through
This book is everything from lovely to tragic But it is tragic in the best ways It is so well written and makes you feel so happy and sad Great book
The book is definitely better than the movie After seeing the movie I had to read the book Such a sad book Makes me appreciate my loved ones more ‚ù§Ô∏è
I'm so in liking of this book I read I wish it never could end So creative I would though like to know what happens to Hazel after she reads the letter‚Ä¶
Great book even though the context was a sad subject it changed the way I felt about sick or cancer children and young adults Can't wait for the movie
A touching insight into the experience of battle with cancer  the patient knows the odds are not in her favor yet she desires to maintain her dignity 
Absolutely endearing novel with characters that you fall in love with and get to know In my experience movies don't measure up but I hope this one does
Such a wonderful story Heartbreakingly so You can't help but fall in love with the characters as you cry with them laugh with them and face oblivion
I'm confidant every reader is capable of relating to this text on a bittersweet level I hope you all revel in it as I have had the opportunity to do so
I thought it was an excellent book and he added so much emotion that it is like real life but it's notAnd John Green keep writing more books thanks
I loved it Normally it would be take a while to read a book but for this one it didn't take a while It was rather too compelling to not put it down
Didn't finish reading the book It was drab writing seemed repetitive and the story was going nowhere I like books that get in &amp; get to the story line
Great story telling what has become an all too common problem of the fight of cancer  The prospective from the teens point of view was very interesting
This book was very sad and good at the same time I would definitely recommend this book to anyone over the age of 12 because it has some mature themes
Wonderful book A great first love story about two adolescents who just happen to be fighting cancer Emotionally gut wrenching have your tissues handy
It was absolutely Amazing As was the movie Very sad and funny as well This is definitely one of my favorite books Even if the end leaves you hungry
Good read  It seemed like an honest perspective of terminal illness; thankfully written with humour and sarcasm to offset the depressing subject matter
Everyone is saying that the book is horrible but this is the best book I have ever read I LOVE this novel do much I recommend this book to everyone :)
This was a great story It was heartwarming funny and emotional I couldn't put it down I think this book should be read especially by younger readers
I loved this book they need another book like this I love you John Green You are amazingI love you but one www question why did Augustus have to die
Not only a book for teenagers a great read for all of us wishing to leave our mark It was tough to read through the tears at times but worth each one
Great book I have not send the movie  not sure if I will they never do justice to the book The middle to end takes you for a real journey if emotions
I can't give it five stars but that's not because it's not good It just doesn't match my personal preferences in writing It's good just not my style
Well written and easy to read The descriptions of the emotions that occur when living with someone with cancer are accurate  Keep the tissue box handy
I loved this book it was very heartfelt and sad but also funny I loved the characters The only thing I didn't like was the way it ended in my opinion
a book about terminal illness and dying that actually had the dark humor I so appreciate Really good story; a little predictable but it is told so well
My first John Green book and it lived up to all I'd heard It's a tear jerker as expected I haven't seen the movie yetbut I'm looking forward to it
this is a great book for young adults wanting or being in love  It gives a goodperspective on how to deal with death and how to look at life afterwards
This book was very good It is both funny bold loving and sad The author paints a good picture of life events and the acceptance people have of them
This is a definite read for any young adult or adult gripping could out it down read it in a day Brings out laughter and tears Excellent excellent
Couldn't put it down whether the first or tenth reading  Hazel gave me glimpses of my own forever which occurred long ago in another set of infinities
Definitely would recommend this book  Fantastic story about life &amp; most of all LOVE  I have read this book several times Definite must read
Real life like book with heart warming details Young difficult loveRecommend for those who enjoy the notebook or other heart warming love stories
I cried like a baby This is one those books that demand to be felt and books that demands to be felt are some of the best well written books
Read this book  Tell your friends about it  Beautiful and brilliant just like its characters this book will make you think and might even change you
Well developed everything A special book about being human I highly recommend it to people oF ALL ages Don't let the teenagers get all the excellence
A book about teens with cancer that felt more like a guide to understanding the emotions of cancer for those who have not personally been strickenyet
This book is an amazing  I fell in love  Such an amazing writer  I'm very excited for the movie  I cried towards the end  So glad I read this book 
Even though the ending of the book is inevitable the love story is SO poignant and unexpected I'm glad I got to read it before I saw the movie version
As sad and tragic as this book is it's also funny and clever It will just utterly break your heart and you will want to read it again immediately after
Such an amazing story  a love story but so much more The fault in our stars will stick with you bring you to tears and make you fall in love with it
This was a good book full of pain sorrow live and honesty  Well enough written for adults but probably will be adored by teen and young adult readers
Genuine voices of believable adolescents  Makes you think about how they lived their lives now and their example when they know they have limited days
This book was beautiful and tough  Well written and a quick read; however a tough subject  Prepare for many pages of tears  I would highly recommend
It was a very sweet book Gus sounds like a hottie Funny moments amidst sadness Slightly predictable but it really doesn't matter Easy quick read
This book was just the right combonation of sad an happy It was a great love story and I enjoyed it I didn't want it to end Everyone should read this
Loved this book but found the characters just a little unbelievable I don't know any teens as intellectually mature and articulate as they--wish I did
I read this book in a day and for me that's pretty amazing considering I don't read unless I have to This story is beautifully written and a must read
This book is really amazing It captures the real meaning of life by telling a story of a boy and a girl having a true love story with a dramatic ending
This is a fantastic novel written  by John Green His extraordinary use of language diction and pathos keep you on your toes throughout the whole novel
One of the best books I have ever read I can't remember the last time I loved a book so much I would highly recommend this book to anyone and everyone
Had a hard time putting this book down  But if you don't want to read about young adults that are ill this book is not for you  Very good book though
Real humorous eye opening glimpse in to the lives of 3 teenagers and their courageous story of finding each other and the friendship/love that evolves
I really liked the book because it was said but it also made me feel so happy because now i know that every one is beautiful even if people dont think it
My daughter age 12 asked me to read this book after she finished it We both felt the same way great book but unsatisfying ending It's worth reading
Truly a beautiful novel Too touching for tears to fall Green reached your heart and took it places you never imagined yet returned it in it's entirety
This book was amazing It was like an emotional rollercoaster first o was laughing then I was so very sad think to the author how could you do this to me
This book is heart-wrenching but a wonderful read  The writing was excellent and the story was unforgettable  My 11-year-old niece also liked the book
This book was absolutely amazing I could not put it down I finished it in a day The love story is outstanding I promise you will not be disappointed
There are more than a dozen quotable moments in Peter Green's too real tale about life and death Beautiful prose not often seen in young adult fiction
It is a wonderful book but very sad  It was difficult to get through because of the subject matter  Makes me feel very lucky to have healthy children
I love reading but I feel this book was very unorganized and kind of skipped all over the place Very Emotional and a great read if you love John Green
This was recommended to me and is an amazing book and written extremely well A lovely book to read Looking forward to reading more of John Greens books
I heard a lot of things going into reading this book; some true some not I never get this into books but TFIOS was one that I would read over and over
This was by far my favorite book I loved everything about it Most definitely a must read I absolutely loved the way the whole thing pieces together
Well written story about relationships and adapting amid the struggles of cancer Beautiful characters and witty dialogue makes for an entertaining ride
John green is my favourite male author This is the second book to make me cry it's that good You get involved and invested with the charters instantly
This book made me cry and will probably make everyone else who reads it cry But besides that it was definitely one of the best books I have ever read
Five stars definitelyIt is so sad but it digs into problems that are real it is fiction but it has an element of truth I recommend u read it ASAP
I read it all in in one breath almost as Augustus and Hazel who know what is true when they see it  Although a work of fiction  this book is so true
I loved it I imagine that she died soon so she could meet up with her true love If only everybody was as honest as Augustus Walters and Hazel Lancaster
An emotionally inspiring story The connection to not only reality but also yourself is what amazed me I didn't just read the book I became part of it
This book was so beautifully written It made me laugh cry and see the metaphors in life I'm very grateful that I read this book A complete must-read
The Fault in Our Stars is a beautifully written story about a young girl's journey to seek stability and meaning in her life when all else seems chaotic
Jim Green outdoes Salinger Hazel never misses a beat Never a false set or note Likely to be read and discussed through the ages  Thanks to Jim Green
this book really makes you feel something I also love how I can easily connect with the characters yet at the same time we couldn't be anymore different
This book hurt me in so many ways to read yet I could not dare discontinue The last words struck me in heart Damn you John Green I love it Speechless
The author does a great job bringing the characters to life while still maintaining a respect for cancer patients  Main characters are very interesting
A bittersweet story that was written in a way that should make any person appreciate the simple things in life Excellent dialogue A story with meaning
Great command of the language Read like prose Made me think Showed great insight into family relationships friendships and disillusionment and hope
This book makes a person think that life is something not to waste and to love your friends and family bc one does not when there best bad day will come
WOW please read Definitely worth the time to thoroughly read through and enjoy the book Made me attached to the characters crazy to read what happens
O my God it's a great story tragically but beautiful at the same time I can stop crying love it please read this lovely and wonderful story
I cried my heart out reading this prescious book This one of the few tragedy themed novels that i like The other one being A Walk to Remember  Enjoy
Entertaining quick read Did help see life through the eyes of people in the main characters circumstance Just not that big of a deal book wise for me
I ordered it for my wife because she was at the bottom of the reading list at the library  She said it was very engaging &amp; enjoyed reading it very much
Absolutely Falwless Read continuously &amp; I did not want to stop Brought tears Emotionally inspiring &amp; loving Beautiful rendition of real genuine love
I always loved learning and reading about cancer this is just unbelievable Must read PS there is a movie of this book and it will come out June 2014
Absolutely beautiful So many things hazel and Augustus said that I will remember forever Reading for my third time today and it won't be the last time
This book offers a unique and beautiful perspective of life through the lens of a sick 16 year old Definitely a book worth reading Prepare the tissues
There have been many reviews for this book already Never has a book touched me in the way that this book has I cried and cried Cancer is a real bitch
This book stayed with me for weeks after I finished it It's a great book It pulls at your heart strings and makes you fall in love with the characters
it's just an amazing book it's so true and if really made me think about life there is twist and love that is bitter-sweet I absolutely love this book
I  really enjoyed this book it was written beautifully and kept me interested The doomed love of two teens Not a new story line but very well executed
I love this book with a passion I cannot believe Gus died though I cried so so much A wondeful breathtaking book My new favorite Does Hazel survive
Incredibly beautiful thought provoking and inspiring I loved everything about this book John Green is a brilliant author Highly recommend this book
This book devastated me and replenished me How enchanting it is to read a book that causes me to soak the pages with my tears yet smiling all the while
Amazing I laughed I cried I thought I feltsometimes you just get to read a book that hits you in the heart This is one of those books Thank you
loved this book / hazel grace &amp; Augustus stole my heart  such a well written story - i laughed smiled cried &amp; kept on reading it  i miss them already
Best book I ever read in my life I cried like a baby Sooo inspirational and heartwarming only took two days to read because I couldn't put it down
I loved this book because it was like a roller coaster ride I was sad happy humored and excited all at the same time That is what a great book does
This book really pulled on my heart strings Although somewhat predictable it never failed to make me think connect the dots and reality this is today
Very good book loved it and there is great romance and morals The main charcter and her lover are really close and happy but the end is heart breaking
I loved the expansive vocabulary the characters used in this book However I did not appreciate the use of of foul language Also as a highly religious person full of wondrous hope for the afterlife I didn't feel like I could connect to the characters as well Beyond all of that this was a beautifully written story I felt that John Green used a writing style similar to my own in some aspects In other ways his writing was so much deeper and more elaborately put together than anything I could could come up with He had such a beautiful way of putting words together That the serious topics he addresses and the depth with which his characters loved each other is what will keep me coming back to his books It was just so sad for me to feel the hopelessness and emptiness that his characters felt It just simply doesn't have to feel that way
I really enjoyed this book I am not usually a reader of YA's- I'm more a judge-a-book-by-its-cover reader which is precisely what I did I saw this on a stand in B&amp;N and it called to me for whatever reason and then I saw the price I waited a week before purchasing it here and I feel now that I wasted a week of my life by not having read this soonerI began and finished this book in one day Not because is was that easy but because it was that good At first I found myself reading it to my boyfriend being all listen to this pretentious line but the more I read the quieter I got until I locked myself in my bedroom to finish I needed the quiet I needed to finish Hours later when I emerged from my library I read parts to my boyfriend but instead I said listen to this beautiful lineTruly a beautiful a read
When I was about to buy this book I didn't really know why I wanted to buy it I don't read a lot of current fiction (where the setting is the current year) and I was asking myself how am I going to relate to a young cancer patient or find this interesting I bought it and discovered that MrGreen guided me on how to relate to a young cancer patient and let me discover how his characters' stories were interesting I don't think I've been more surprised by a book in my life I can remember almost all of it the jokes the heartbreaking moments the not-so-good/boring parts even weeks after finishing It really says a lot about an author when you can pick out the parts you didn't even like and notice they have a purpose in the story and it shows a different side to the book Every part of this book is memorable and an experience unto itself
I have cancer so I thought I would really relate to and enjoy this movie I was so wrong This movie was definitely intended for very young girls
This book is amazing I laughed I cried and I smiled a lot Augustus Waters may be the perfect man and I'm happy to have met him by reading this story
This was a very good bookthe author did a good job keeping us guessingi would recommend it to all my daughters daughter-in-laws and granddaughters
This is a beautiful story of love for all ages  I look forward to seeing the movie soon and reading more of what this author has to offer  Great book
It was written very easy to read and I could connect to the characters as of knowing people who I loved that had cancer and the pain they went through
Wonderful read Truehonest bold and heart warming Would recommend for a anyone to read The dynamic of the characters was intriguing and fascinating
I thought I would have something to read in my spare time I was done reading it in 3 days Nope not THAT short of a read I just couldn't put it down
Great story  I was determined to read it before the movie came out  Now I really don't feel interested to see the movie  The book probably is better
An excellent read  John Green is an amazing author  While geared at younger folks this book is a must read BEFORE you see the movie (also excellent)
This was a good read I enjoyed this author and will look for his other booksWould recommend this book and I'm going to try and watch the movie b
My daughter loves this book  It intrigued her so much that she stayed up for hours finishing the book right before the movie came out this past summer
the fault in our stars is a good book for adults and teenagers it is a very good story and sends a good message it is now by far my favorite book
Absolutely loved it but be prepared to have a box of tissues on hand  Incredibly sad  You could really feel for each of the characters  Well-written
Just wanted a small good read and this was exactly it Haven't seen the movie yet but I know the book did a great job of portraying the story Love it
This book was Outstanding - Everything I thought it would be It was in New condition and all of the pages were in tack Will definitely buy other books
This book is cleverly written and gives you a sense of joy and appreciation for life and love I can't wait to start reading other novels by John Green
My granddaughter told me I had to read it  She was right it's a wonderful book  Haven't seen the movie yet but I'm sure it's not as good as the book
This was definitely an interesting and easy read There could have been a better ending though It's kind of  just a clich√© love story with sick people
BEST BOOK EVER I recommend this to teens and adults I picked this 5 star rating because it deserves it greatly Read it and you'll find out why
A raw brutal book about living knowing that dying was imminent Painful every page and every chapter yet real models of friendship love and commitment
A book that makes you feel a variety of emotions at once  Makes you want to slow down and truly take in the little things that this world has to offer
It's like the titanic you know it's coming But it's soo good The descriptions of cancer are hard to read if you have ever known someone with cancer
I loved this book I found myself crying and smiling throughout the story Didn't want it to end and hoped to have known what became of Hazel and Isaac
Indy Portrayed well Characters easy to relate to Could be non-fiction easilyWorth the read  Now to see the movie Many scenes familiar
So this is just like the book she was readingit leaves you wondering what happened to Hazel  Love the story but wish I knew what happens to her
This is not just a story about having cancer and dying It is about two teens who are falling in love for the first time and just happen to have cancer
I laughed and a cried This is a beautifully written story about a topic so many have lived and died with Warningyou will need to has tissues handy
Great sad story Language is a little badbut gets the point across Great encouragement for people to keep fighting You can't have joy without pain
What great book  The expression of love and dying is very touching  I will go see the movie now  I am pretty sure it will not be as good as the book
I chose this rating because it was sweetand nice that he did that for her he was their for her and sees he didn't even know when  she was in the ICU
As good as people said it was  Very sad but also very heart-warming  So good that these two teens could find this relationship in the midst of cancer
Definitely a young adult novel but I can see what all the hype is about It's a little dark a little light but overall entertaining and an easy read
One if the best books I ever read In the top 10 and I highlighted more phrases that moved me than in any other Kindle book Very highly recommend this
This was such an insightful story  It was 'real' and blunt  Deeply philosophical and even a bit sad but not without some fantastic intellectual humor
This book is awesome I was driven to finish due to the astonishing details The whole book I could picture The Fault In Our Stars is the book to read
The Fault in Our Stars is a brilliantly written book I love the relationship between Hazel and Augustus more than any other one I have ever read about
I read this book in less than 2 days It was intense funny sad and real It's not so sad that you should skip this book as it really is a great read
I don't know why all the hype- it was to predictable Great dialog/Very well written though but not something I would read again or pay to see the movie
Amazing story - deeply moving creative twists heart achingly captivating could not put this down Incredible job with this book Very touching story
A wonderful romance/tragedy/coming of age/facing mortality melting pot of story line Ranks right up there with My Sisters Keeper or Death Be Not Proud
AMAZINGJUST AMAZING An absolute masterpiece The connections throughout the book has me completely living in their world Very well written
So much less a story about two cancer kids and more about how their love transformed their lives Amazing Hands down one of the best I have ever read
This is an absolutely beautiful book and one I'll probably read more than once (which I rarely do) Be warned though: keep tissues handy It's a weeper
This book was known as a chick flick but this book is not your regular flick Girls will cry at how beautiful Augustus words are Worth the money 100%
Excellent book touching that difficult area of life where death lives and personal development is forced to a new dimension of raw and poignant reality
Great read and although about teens a book for all ages I cried laughed and experienced the book which is rarehighest of praise to the author
amazeballs amazing i loved captures audience movie awesome too very romantic teenagers unusually mature but still brilliant novel -- will love
Great bookhard to believe its fictionalYou can't put it down  It makes you very emotional  The writer really knows how to get you hooked in
Amazing perfect sad great horrible emotional best ever cute adorable sweet crying beautiful love stars fault good cool lovely THE BEST
This short novel kept me engaged and interested in the characters from start to finish I only wish we could learn more about the future of Hazel Grace
loved this story of young love terminal illnesses looking for answers as to why looking forward to the movie sure it will not be as good as the book
Great book on life and love and the anguish it can cause and yet the freedom and joy it gives I cried when a main character died I laughed I cheered
I'm only writing this to get to my next book and kindle is forcing this review on me  The book was ok  It was very depressing and offered little hope
It is a sad but deep love story that teaches people the meaning of life and love I don't regret buying this book and can read it over and over again
I have no words for how this book moved me Brilliantly written and a quick read I'm not sure I could bare to read it twice Beautiful just beautiful
I loved this book Wanted to read before the movie comes out It was a really quick read but one that was do hard to put down Can't wait for the movie
Amazing book with a service different view on illness that I adored thank you for giving us a new experience in feelings it was beautiful and redeeming
I Liked How It Was Real Nothing Was Sugar Coated I Would Recommend This Book To Everyone Because It Shows That Everyone Deserves To Love And Be Loved
This book caught my attention on the first page I couldn't put this book down and I felt attached to the characters Maybe okay will be our always :)
I enjoyed this easy read book immensely even though I cried several timesTake a fantasy ride though the eyes of a cancer stricken teenager
I listened to this as a audio book and it was great I would highly recommend for anyone that loves a good read and one that is heartfelt and emotional
I felt like the beginning dragged  on I wish more events happened throughout the book Overall the story was good and  I am excited to see the movie
Engaging from the first page I read this book in a bout a day- I couldn't put it down Character development was great and the story was heartwrenching
This is one if the most touching books I have read in awhile It makes you appreciate what we have and that we aren't supposed to take life for granted
this book is a great love story that is filled with traffic details I would never get tired of reading this book this is the best book I have ever read
Wonderful read I think this should be required reading for everyone First book in quite some time that made me laugh out loud and cry crocodile tears
Emotional book well written Definitely worth the read I could not put the book down and the characters stayed with me well after I finished the book
A wonderful story about loving and losing and accepting John Green understands cancer teenagers and the fear of the pain we leave behind when we die
Recommended by one of my girl scout teensI think it showed how teens can be intelligent and caring and adults don't give them enough credit for that
Excellent book  Quick read  Well done and not quite what I expected  A book about youth with cancer seems morose and it was not  Highly recommended
asdfghjklasdfghjkl I just can't I just can't It's literally too good for words Like I said earlier asdfghjklasdfghjkl There is NOTHING to critique
I'm not always an avid reader but this book is worth you You fall in love with the story Also would recommend Paper Towns by John Green Great author
All of the jewels finally fall into place and the stars make one unforgettable picture Sometimes such beauty brings a tear to your eyes but it's okay
Honestly one of the best books I've ever read I fell in love with the characters and storyline completely Definitely would recommend it to everyone
I really enjoyed reading this novel- I found it to be both a quick read and one that I could get emotionally involved in Great storyOkay
nearly highlighted the whole book but then I thought oh yeah I could always just read the book againBest book I've read in a long time
If you want a young teenage love story this is the book for youYou will cry you will love this bookJohn green did a great job on this book
I fell in love with the characters and very much appreciated how the author told their story I'm suggesting this book to everyone I know It's SO GOOD
I was afraid to read TFIOS because I heard many people say how devastating it is I found comfort in knowing that life can be sweet no matter how short
This book is amazing It is full of such wisdom You'll read it and realize things you didn't before It's sad and you will cry But god is it worth it
Wow This is one of those books you want to end to see how it ends but then are crushed when it does end Great story with incredible writing Loved it
What an incredibly powerful story about truth honesty and love It will fill your whole heart and challenge your mind A definite must read
This book was honestly mind boggling in the best way possibleYou are constantly on a rollercoaster that is only going upBravo John Green
It describes human nature and how individuals are able to give their own opinion and speak the truth without another's criticism or judgement mattering
This is a beautiful story about star crossed lovers/cancer fighters It's wonderfully thoughtfully written Highly recommended but have tissues handy
Beautiful touching and haunting Enjoyed this book immensely Just wanted to leave 5 stars :-) looking forward to reading additional John green books
it took me a day to finish because I wanted to keep reading and reading until I finished the whole thing  I absolutely recommend The Fault in Our Stars
You will not be disappointed it has such a moving meaning and you can't put it down You get so attached to the characters to let go I LOVED this story
This book is so well written I didn't want to put it down The characters hazel and Gus win your heart Definitely makes you think deeply about life
Pure emotionsimple and deep For those who love to feel and naturally notice the universe around them Thank you John Green for writing this book
There aren't enough words in the world to describe this book There just aren't If you have never cried before don't worry You will if you read this
It makes you believe that It might be a real story It's sad and happy and sad and happy again The fault in our stars reminds you that life is not fair
This book was beautifully written I will be reading more of John Green It was  heartbreaking and haunting  The story will stay with me for some time
I quite enjoyed this book reading it in its entirety in one day  The writing is smooth and portrays excellent characterization I highly recommend it
The Fault In Our Stars  I found the book interesting but appealing to a high school age person more than an adult  I am not a fan of depressing books
Laughed shuddered wept cheered and pondered life reading this book Great read my daughter's name is Hazel and it guts me reading the final pages
All the feels without all of the sticky sweet empty prose that usually informs books of this nature A sincere upgrade for any Nicholas Sparks lackey
i loved it i loved the way Hazel and Gus talking to each other Sometimes I thought Hazel can be somewhat sarcastic but that really made me love her
Me to places I always knew existed but never knew how to get to My heart leapt and sunk all in the same moment It is hard to read with tears flowing
The first book about terminal illness I've ever read that bringsReal insight Luminous an tangible So blessed to have an author like John Green
I just loved it so beautiful Hazel and Augustus would be proud I can't get over the writing so neat and concise It truly is an inspiration for me
There are some grammatical errors and incorrect word choices so editing could have been better But the characters are good You buy into their story
Just touching I was reluctant to read after my father had passed due to cancer but so glad I didYou will understand when you read okay

The book is a heart breaking but wonderful book for me to read the shipment came in 5 days and its in perfect condition I am so pleased with this :D
Extremely well written and poignant The characters are defined by their intelligence and morality not their cancers Not just a book for young adults

Amazing love story Inspiring and full of life lessons that will stick with you forever  This is the best romantic novel after The Notebook
I laughed I didn't cry quick read not going to see the movie  Feeling like I'm over YA books  The author's assessment of V for Vendetta was whack
AMAZING On  of the best books I've ever read and I've read a LOT of books I've never cured in a book until now it's such a cute heart working book
John Green is probably the best author I have came across His words are beautifully written My words are stars I cannot fathom into constellations
I have to admit that I hated this book until I got to the very end It is definitely one of those books that you hate to love It was great in the end
These book was quite extraordinary These makes cry every at the end of it John Green you are outstanding Can't wait to see it in the movie theaters
This book is smart and witty emotional and brilliant  The book is sarcastic and funny as well as deeply insightful  I would recommend it to anyone

Wonderful book Worth the read And the price for a New York Bestseller can't be beat Always delivered quickly so a great book even for the Kindle app
Well written entertaining book  Easy to get involved in the storyProbably a late teen read for the more mature subject matter
I strongly believe it is a 5 star book because it is a story of love and hardship in life and people working through it In other words it is inspiring
An emotional roller coaster Lots of twists and turns I read it from cover to cover and could not put it down Can't wait to see the movie adaptation
I have never laughed and cried in so close a span of time and nonetheless while reading  Best book I've read in quite some time Thank you Mr Green
I loved this heart felt book I cried from the beginning to the end  Love is beautiful and amazing I enjoyed this book and would highly recommend it
Am looking forward to the movie but am glad I read the book first Hazel and August are memorable and I'm glad I got to spend some time in their world
This book took my breath away I'm looking forward to the movie even though it'll probably not be as amazing Love love love this one My fave so far
Just Beautiful No more word BeautifulAugustus Waters and Hazel Grace made me cryReally BadLoye this book so muchBeautiful
You can't help but admire and respect these young characters and a sad ending that makes you happyIt is an easy read and great for a rainy weekend
I have never shared my view on any book before but I felt compelled to do so with this one It was amazing My review is so profound  I'll stop here
I was excited to read this book but became dissapointed when it didnt make much since with big words and all Im still going to watch the movie though
This book was absolutely amazing and I loved it more than any other book I've read Considering I read it in only two days I think that's saying a lot
Loved this book  Very heartwarming and seems to be fairly realistic  I know it's read by young adults but as a 41 year old mom I really enjoyed it
At the heart of it it's a love story Like able and realistic characters Really tries to capture the meaning of life but also how that is impossible
Really enjoyed reading this book  It did make me cry but great and fast read  Can't wait to see the movie although movies never do the books justice
What a lovely book - like poetry - despite its tough topic  I couldn't put it down and wish I knew more about what happens to the characters Ironic
Beautifully written  Warm compassionate and funny as heck especially when you consider the subject matter  Loved this book and the insight of Green
This book was pure torture  Not pure actually - parts were downright pithy but I couldn't seem to put it down for all it's pain and agonizing truth
I don't know how many years I've shed or how many smiles this had put on my face It's a beautifully written books with as many ups as there are downs
Such a wonderful and intensely emotional book  I think everyone needs to be read this book it is a beautiful novel  John Green is a authorial genius
It's the sad but happy side of a deadly disease LONG LIVE AUGUSTUS WATERS &lt;33333 Poor Hazel lost him too early I loved his character though

I laughed and I cried Easy read and well written LOVED this book I couldn't put it down Definitely worth your time and could read it in a weekend
The story of love has never been so beautifully articulated If I ever took life for granted I will no longer Feeling grateful to be alive and loved

It shows a different perspective of living life to the fullest when faced with a fatal disease and living one day at a time Beautiful touching novel
I liked it because it was sad but it was alive story; it had humorous parts too A few books I have read left an imprint I'm sure this is going to too
This was such a great book Well written and thoughtful and invigorating and fresh and emotional and oh gosh Just get the damn book It's really good
it's perfect and everyone on earth needs to read iteven if you're going through chemo like me especially if you're going through chemo like me
I really can't find better words to describe this book except to say the story and characters as lovely and honest in all their flaws and I love that
I haven't had a chance to read it yet but both daughters (13 and 15) have read it and the 15 yr old plans to re-read it soon  Must be pretty engaging
I thought Hazel did a lot of whining in the book and Gus was portrayed as some kind of super human figure  I would not recommend this book to anyone
This is a great book My friend has cancer and this really helps me to know what is going on Thank you for opening my eyes to see what my friend sees
John Green makes cancer beautiful A very touching love story written so delicately about two young cancer ridden teenagersdefinitely a must read
This book is one that I have been wanting to read It pretty much states the tragic love story I'm in love with all the characters Very well written
and I typically do not read or like love stories  What a pleasant surprise the laughs I laughed the shouts I shouted and the tears I dried
Although the conversations and words used are not usually said by teenagers it was a great story and I read it in less than two days Would recommend
Brilliantly written Definite tear jerker Soul touching story I've read it twice now and I can honestly say that this is my most favorite book Okay
I read this book in one sitting but felt a wide array of emotions Exquisite pain beauty joy sadness and most of all love Thank you John Green
by far the best book I've read in awhileI laughed and cried but it was one of the best books I've ever readI highly recommend reading it
Unique book that gives a great perspective on the reality of mortality I would recommend this book to anyone mature enough to handle death in a story
Very touching story that talks about love death and life A definite page-turner Worth reading again and again Rare perspective of cancer survivors
Great easy read Would recommend to anyone and everyone It compels you to live more and touch your soul for the sake of the universe and nothing more
I recommend this book to anyone who wants to get a good cry in It's a sad story but it will make you have a new out look on lifeSamantha
Quick read which pulls on the heart strings and represents teenage love in a manner that any girl would appreciate Sad at times but a satisfying read
I loved it so much but Augustus during was a little heart wrenching  But that just proves how good of a book it was I hope to read more of your work
Indescribably good like i cant tell you how good this book is So please buy this book Please do it for yourself or perhaps me Actually do it for me
Lovelythoughtful book with wonderfully quirky main characters  Most intelligent teenagers on earth but the book would not have worked any other way
It was a good read about dealing and living with cancer  It was a 16 year old girl who had cancer that became involved with a boy who also had cancer
This book made me cry towards the end and normally books don't get me that emotionally involved A new take on cancer and those who survive(and don't)
I loved the story Read it very quickly as its light but also heartbreaking to see how different life can be for people involved in terminal illnesses
Such a different story; couldn't put it down  While not the most uplifting book such a great read and a book written with powerful emotion Loved it
It made me tear up so much I love this book :)) hopefully one day we will be able to read this book like Shakespeare  John Green is very gifted :))
This book is amazing By far the best book I have ever read And trust me I've read A LOT I highly recommend you read this book You won't regret it
Completely head over heels for this book Nothing can compare Highly recommend it I could hardly put it downHeads up; it'll make you cry

An inspiring drama
Just to sad for me
This book is amazing‚Ä¶and I loved reading it Some of th  words in there I did not understand but then I just looked them upI would suggest this book
This book was very interesting as well as heartbreaking I loved the relationship the main characters built before it all came to an end A must read
Worth reading  The dialog is clever  For a very sad story it doesn't really get too far over the edge  Some parts of the story are a bit contrived
Great book and movie goes so close to it that ud guess what they look like when reading and true what they picked out for movieread book then movie
This book made me cry I read it in less than a day The word choices are just astonishing Every one needs to read the book and fall in love with it
Shouldn't read in public you will cry This book is awesome and definitely makes you think differently on life and on the lives of people with cancer
Sad and hopeful and beautiful all at the same timeI read this on the urging of my daughter She does have the best taste in booksLoved it
Need a good cry Here you go I enjoyed the different personalities in this book although I thought they were a bit more mature than 16/17 years old
I think this was the best book I've read in along time I believe as a nurse that all parents should read this book in preparation for what could be
This is a very beautiful love story between two teenage cancer patients  If you find yourself crying  near the end it's ok just let the tears flow
Of course I cried as I'm sure most do at his beautiful honest in your face story about the nasty C word It is very real and heartbreakingly funny
Recommend to anyone who has felt loss or gone through challenges with someoneThis is for teens through adultsYou won't forget this read
Beautifully written love story and human nature story I rarelyBecome emotional reading a book But did Peter Van Houton character well written
I am in love with this story I had to read the book before I could watch the movie The one touch purchasing is addictive and will get me in trouble
At the beginning I almost put the book down because it thought I wouldn't like it but as I read on I couldn't stop until I finished  A must read
well written the main characters have a great banter and sarcastic humor that kept the flow of the story funny and still happy for what it was about
Awesome book with super fast delivery time hasn't even on my expected delivery date and it arrived Love this book so much I reccomend it to everyone
Wonderful book  Bring on the tissues I couldn't put this book down even through the tears  I could feel the love between the characters instantly
What an excellent read A beautiful story of love triumph pain hope and the power of believing An easy read quick to release a boatload of tears
It was not a waste of my time I like the intelligence the author credits the young adult reader The vocabulary and metaphors are not simple cliches
Moving account of three lives struggling to reconcile cancer's calling card Surprising twist ends the book with Hazel on top of her game Great read
A bit of a downer due to subject matter But good perspective and makes you think Live life to the fullest Even if there are jerks in it
I thought at the beginning it started slow but once you got to the middle it started to get interesting where you did not want to put the book down
This book is absolute perfection I finished it within hours and couldn't put it down I cried and laughed there was never a dull moment in this book
I love this book It is inspiring I believe I have a fictional best friend now (Hazel Grace Lancaster) I'm in love with both the book and the movie
Not much of a book reader but this book captured my attention to the end A nice romance that demonstrates unconditional love during a difficult time
This story of Hazel and Augustus touched my heart There are so many messages to be derived from this amazing story I recommend this book to anybody
Not for the faint of heart Truly heartwarming AND heart wrenching a must read I will be rereading this many times in the years (hopefully) to come
Very fast paced and the book is very unique Read this book because it also helped me understand more about cancer I can't wait to read paper towns
I love this book it is the best book read and longest I am going to see the move soon So if you are read this get the bookPS it made me cry
Great book  I'm ready to read it again  I thought I knew what  was going to happen but I had a couple of surprises  Can't wait to see the movie now
Great book  Wasn't a fan of the ending kinda left me hanging and wondering just like hazel wondered about Anna  But I understand the idea behind it
Never have a cried reading a bookThis book is life changing and completely the most amazing book I've ever read in my lifedefinitely my new favorite
Amazing insight on the world and how little our actual problems are compared to the ones we don't notice are even happening  Definitely a tear jerker
Possibly the sweetest thing I have ever read Simply beautiful Actually makes me want to be a writer Think about the beauty and notice the universe
This book was outstanding Very hard to put down The maturity of these teenage characters is admirable This story really puts things in perspective
As sad as it is there is a huge part that is wonderful sweet romantic and sometimes even funny  I thoroughly enjoyed it and couldn't put it down
Throughout the development of his book Green really gets you to think about the value of a life as well as how to cope with things you cannot change
One of the best books I have ever read really I just can't get over the fact of how much they loved each other easily one of my top 5 favorites :')
This is the first book I read in 20 years  I first saw the movie then read the book  My daughter is the one I blame for this and I thank her for it
This was a truly moving work that asks some good questions  It shows great potential for John Green to become a preeminent thinker in our modern age
Beautifully heart wrenching  Leaves you breathless and reminds you of the fragility of youth  Brings you back to a place of hope wonder and faith
I did enjoy this story and love that they fell in love and was able to tell their story I can't wait to watch the movie to be able to see this story
I didn't really know if I would like this story when my friend told me to read it but I really enjoyed it  Sad topic but realty isn't always happy
BEST  BOOK  EVER  I loved loved loved this book Anyone who likes sappy but realistic love books I highly recommend this book Five stars no doubt
I have never felt the emotion I felt when reading this book So beautifully written and very moving I recommend this book very very very very highly
Awesome bookBeing in the medical field I totally got wrapped up in the medical part of the book but soon the passion of these  kids amazed me
I am completely overwhelmingly sad This book is the best book I have ever read I read it in two days and I laughed and cried What happens to Hazel
This books is beautifully crafted and well-written Each chapter pulls you in closer and closer until you too are part of this magnificent love story
As a mother of two small kids reading a book in two days is a feat I'm sleep deprived but my heart is full what a wonderful way to tell a sad story
Great book Even greater love story It has the perfect touch of English literature and an amazing modern love story to pull on anyone's heartstrings
A beautiful story beautifully written  It brought tears and laughter- two of my favorite emotions to feel when I read I highly recommend this book
I can't imagine a life without my husband of 27 years Like this book love is real sometimes challenging sometimes easy and lazy and always genuine
Very easy quick read I thoroughly enjoyed reading it It felt a little too fake at times but it was a beautifully written story about love and loss
One of the best books I believe I've ever read Such an amazing story and definitely worth the timerecommend from about seventh or eighth grade - up
This book is a fantastic and eloquently written piece of literature If you want a heartfelt and extremely touching read I highly recommend this book
There is little to say that I felt while reading this because I don't want to ruin the beauty of it with my own words So simply put: read this one :)
This book is truly amazing it shows how two people can passionately fall in love even with their unusual scars they are the true meaning of heroism
Honestly I'm touched by this story of love and innocence and fear and death and quite frankly the reality of it is worth reading it's not a fairy tale
never did I enjoy shedding tearnever did tears express so littlenever did life seem like fictionnever did fiction seem like life
I loved this story I just adore Augustus and Hazel just broke my heartso much courage and strength I don't think I would've been that strong
This was a very moving novel i enjoyed it very much Very emotional and you really sympathized with the characters  I would definitely recommend it
This book is so good John Green is a wonderful authorYou get happy and sad reading this book and that's a great thing This book is beautiful
The quirky characters kept my interest I liked the characters and how they were dealing with their mortality Good author - I like his writing style
Sad funny and interesting  Characters family dynamics and individual coping mechanisms were well established  Writer hit on all of these subjects
While this was a good book (read because of book club selection) it certainly wasn't epic and really not worth all the hype and lack of availability
This book has taught me so much on how to look at life It was also greatly written I had my moments of tears but I also had my moments of laughter
A well written and emotional story that is wonderful for a quick read I work at a cancer organization so it was interesting to have this perspective
After reading this novel one must take into account the life they have today Make it count Hopefully reading this novel bettered you It did for me
I would recommend this bookto everyone I know know  this a must feasible the characters especially Gus he is worth knowing I feel he is so real

oooooh yeah  This is more like it  Happened to open this on a drizzling boring dayHARKwhat do you know  They DO still write books like this
What an awesome story-teller  The characters become real and you smile for their triumphs and you cry (well I actually bawled) for their tragedies
Amazing book I couldn't put it down Simply yet elegantly written Packed with emotion I laughed I cried I can't wait to read more by John Green

This book is amazing I was so deprecated at the end John Green you are an amazing author and I hope all your other books are as amazing as this one
When I started reading it it was a little boring But it started to turn into a love story I'd recommend this book if you like to read love stories
Beautifully tragic and absolutely stunning It's everything you want and everything you don't Excellently written and wonderfully poetic to the core
Unlike what I thought I'd be It was funny and touching I feel like i know the characters It was sad but not slit your wrist sad it was just perfect
It was amazing Heartfelt and very great I would read it over and over again It's the best and I can relate do to the fact I had osteosarcoma cancer
Inspiring puts dying into a realistic perspective The characters give realistic insight into a world unknown but wanting to be understood by others
You will laugh cry and scream at this book This book shows you few meanings and gives you would that will stick with you for the rest of your life
This book is a must read It shows a real picture of how young teenagers feel when they know they are going to die sooner than needed Love this book
I just finished while in my favorite coffee shoptears in my coffee and worth it Beautiful book I will carry quotes in my head for time to come
i was so in love with this book that i read very little everyday bc i couldnt even bear the thought of finishing such a wonderful and perfect book omg
Honestly this is truly the best book I have ever read The only thing I wish had come out of It is if John green would write An Imperial Affliction
I didn't know much about this book when I began reading it I think that is best This is a fabulous read Beautifully written I highly recommend it
Personally I loved the book It's a classic love story but with plenty of twists and turns to keep the reader interested I would highly recommend it
I enjoyed and was inspired by the book but the age of the characters didn't agree in my mind with their wisdom and philosophies on death and dying
Not my favorite book ever but a pretty good story if you haven't seen the trailer than you absolutely have to see it even if you don't read the book
I'm not one who loves to read but I couldn't put the book down I fell inlove with the characters I recommend reading the book with a box of tissues
She did it backwards but that should speak volumes of the movie that after she saw the movie she then wanted the book She loved the book even more
Really threw me for a loop when Augustus ended up being the sick one At that point I couldn't put the book down wondering what the outcome would be
John Green really knows how to write a page turner but pleaseget your tissues ready before you reach the last 3rd of the book I love this story
This is an amazing book  It puts one's own problems into perspective &amp; makes the reader grasp what really is important  Loving others is important
Very well-written and captivating Deep sad at times (I cried a few real tears) but I was left feeling happy having read it Have not seen the film
Such a good book I was definitely happy I read it when no one else was around because I cried like a baby I definitely recommend reading this book
Sweet and sour romance it run your heart through the full gauntlet of emotions  After reading the book I don't know if I can face the film version
Maybe too close to home for me right now but I grieved through it Recently lost my daughter to cancer and trying to find how I fit in the world now

This book was such a page turner I couldn't put it down I find it very interesting to read about how people's lives are were battling awful cancer
Perfect combination of comedy and tragedy Realistic love story with just enough whim and fantasy Leaves you with a strange mix of sadness and hope
The first 3/4 of the book is a sleeper The last quarter is a tear jerkerreminds us to never take life for granted Excited to see the movie next
I usually don't really like to read that much but when I started to read this book I fell in love with it like we fall asleep slowly then all at once
This is such an inspiring book and so important I have learned about a world that I didn't know existed yet so many people I know have lived there
Inspired writing in the ugly face of cancer and death  Yet young love is able to shine through all tragedy allowing the living to live while dying
This book was amazing  I did not want to put it down  I highly recommend it to people of all ages  If you liked the movie you will LOVE the book
Whether you are a 13 year old girl or a middle aged man read this book The author tells a thought provoking story that can be enjoyed by all of us
This is a great book  I cried laugh and experienced the love of two star-crossed kids with cancer  Beautiful story  Can't wait to see the movie
absolute beautiful heart wrenching love story Loved the raw realization that life and love are fragile beautiful hurtful moments Great read
Well written sad topic but very interesting content  From a medical professional's view I enjoyed reading the teen's perspective on death &amp; dying
An oxygen tank doesn't kill the fire of love and kindness between two innocent in love but burned by cancer fights from finding fulfillment and hope
I had heard how good this book was I have to say it truly is it's beautiful and so heartbreaking I'm glad I read it even if it left me with tears
Great book I grew up in Indiana and currently live in Indianapolis so it was fun reading a book based here Grab some tissues though Very worth it
A heartbreaking and touching story but very realistic perspectives of how cancer affects others around you and the way you think and feel about it
Well written Just not for everyone Sad and many happy people will not want the burden of taking on more when there is so much in the world already
what a lovely story it was a true tale of unconventional love that can happen between two people who are brought together based on one circumstance
I enjoyed this book it was an easy read It was not dragged out I would recommend people of all ages reading it It is a good read for young adults
Really enjoyed his book (was way better than the movie) Loved everyone of the characters and their emotions that were portrayed throughout the book
The Fault in our Stars is an entertainingly and enjoyable read but somewhat predictableenjoyed the characters of a world I know very little about
Realistic depiction of the emotions tensions and pain of dealing with a death sentence disease while also managing to be humorous and not maudlin
Cried all the way through I couldn't put it down and needed to know what happened next highly recommended only complaint is I wish it was longer
It is the only item I will ever even rate on Amazon just in the hopes that my rating will cause someone else to want to read this eye-opening story
Very quick and easy read An interesting perspective into the hearts and minds of young cancer patients  I'm looking forward to watching the movie
This book was entertaining thought provoking and heart- wrenchingly beautiful  There is much to be learned here I highly recommend this treasure
I won't even attempt any type of description of the words John Green has written within these pages I can only say that I myself am simply amazed
I adore this book It's sensible yet challenging I guess it's the word I highly recommend this book Warning: May cause crying or break downs Haha
The fault in our stars was absolutely Beautiful heart breaking captivating wrenching stunning breathtaking so real so so incredibly worthwhile
I thoroughly enjoyed this bookmade you see things in a Different light I would recommend good readcannot wait to see on the big screen
All I have to say is that I want to be loved like Augustus loved Hazel Their love was beautiful and deep and unconventional Truly a wonderful book
I am not nearly as good a writer as John Green is so I'll simply say that this is an amazing book that made me feel things I have never felt before
Wonderfully written &amp; very easy readHeart warming sad story but yet you feel the love &amp; happinessI would recommend to friends &amp; family
This is an extremely funny and romantic book that I honestly could not think could have been worded or placed any different or any better in any way
I absolutely loved this book It had its funny moments and it had its really sad moments It is the best book I that I have read in a very long time
Very good storyline and characters I couldn't put it down once I started reading it The story is diverse in its feelings from happiness to sadness
Found it easy to read and wanted to keep reading it  A tough subject in that its about 2 teenagers with cancer but it included humorous moments too
There wasn't a whole lot to this book but what was there was deep  I did expect a little more from the plot but it was an easy and enjoyable read
This is for a young gen e ration of lovers The characters are interesting to as point then the sad on going death march takes over and never stops
I loved this book from beginning to end one of those books you just can't put down awaiting the movie however as it goes the book is always better
Such a good book Made me cry and laugh and smile and scream at some points John green I tip my hat to you Amazing job and wonderfully made story
it was a story I read in 2 days because I wanted to know what happened next Great read hopefully they don't mess it up when turning it into a movie
Just enough comedy and just enough tragedy Satisfied Just because this review is requiring me to type more I will add that I recommend this book :)
This book is about teens with cancer and young love It is a great book an easy read The movie comes out in June I can't wait to see the movie
This book was awesome First time I cried over a character dying in the book I loved the love between Augustus and hazel Wow so happy I read this
This is one of the best books I have ever read Although it has language issues and a little adult content  It is just way to good to put into words
Exquisitely written beautifully developed characters heartbreaking and honest  I read this in less than two days and didn't want the story to end
My 15 year old daughter recommended this book to me  It was an easy read and I didn't want to put it down  Just be aware that you may need tissues
It was extremely  sad but was written in an interesting way and was a very good story  I really enjoyed it and also found it a learning experience
beautiful  tragic  can't stop the feels  The best thing I've read in quite some time  Strongly recommend to anyone who enjoys a great love story
This book has very quickly become one of my all time favorite  I will reread this book so many times I will lose count Absolutely phenomenal book
Depressing story about 2 young kids w cancer  I kept hoping the story would turn around &amp; have a happy ending  I'm sure you can guess what happens
I'm 68 (most likely not the intended audience) and a voracious reader and I've never read a love story that's touched me as deeply as this one has
Although tragically sad the fault in our stars is a beautiful novel that just makes you realize how wonderful life is We are all just side effects
Beautiful book Amazing dialogues amazing portrayal of characters And with decent bit of surprises recommended for readers of every category
The Fault in Our Stars touch my heart unlike any book I have read It is excellent novel I couldn't put it down The characters became a part of me
It's so funny and smartly writtenI love this book I mean besides all of the sickness there are stories within stories in this book A MUST read
The characters continue to grow; their souls continue to evolve until suddenly they are a combination of all that have experienced a terminal illness
Great story and even better characters There's some good life lessons to be learned with this one Get your tissues ready before starting the book
‚Ä¶‚Ä¶ Words to describe this book are endless But you cannot hide that it is terrible-y awesome The ending is the bestI do AugustusI do
Great book for teens  My daughter and I read it and we both cried--it was nice to have something to talk about besides go clean your room
I gab  the fault in our stars a 5 star rating because it certainly deserved itThis book made me realize that life is not forever but it is infinite
Very well written book The writer really knows how to bring the characters to life You feel their pain and their joy I highly recommend this book
Don't quite get all the hype It was an okay book Thought the character development was a little lacking Gus and hazel were a little 2-dimensional
Thoroughly enjoyable  and thought provoking read the characters were very believable and the book would interest all ages I found myself engrossed
This was the first book I have read from John Green and I really liked the way he wrote about something so sad but made it humorous at the same time
Like it very much  Make me cry in a good way  It was a great surprise seeing in a theater poster that there is a movie from the story in the way
this is truly a book to read and read and read so many beautifully written words and sentiment I'm crying but would read the whole thing over again
The fault in our stars was an amazing book and I have read it multiple times I would recommend it for anyone who is looking for a good book to read
Wonderful wonderful I recommend this book to everyone Really makes you appreciate life and time I read it in one day and can't wait for the movie
A great read I highly recommend this book to anyone who enjoys some good quality cynicism spattered throughout a tragic but very sweet love story
This book made me cry laugh and just altogether feel good I made a great decision reading this book it was so perfectly concocted All good things
Great well written heartbreaking story Can't wait to read other books by John Green Would love to read again but don't know if my heart can take it
I read this book because the movie about it is coming out this summer  I really enjoyed it and I would recommend to anyone who likes romance novels
This book is sooooo good it will make you cry I love this book and I hate to read but the  book changed my thoughts about reading and changed my life
the best it truly is amazing I love how thoughtful every thing is it really hits the heart and makes you fall in love with reading all over again
It does give you heart warming moments but if you are not able to crawl into your bed after reading it you should maybe find something else to read
What can I say - this book is American - it‚Äôs written like a script of a movie that must be made Keeps you focused reading fast EXCELLENT writing
As always John Green has delivered a perfect book that will stay with me forever I laughed I criedI will return to Hazel and Gus again I am sure
Word cannot fathom the words and emotions on these pages Excellent read and highly recommended to all looking for something of substance and emotion
Excellent read It makes you examine your life and feel grateful for everything you have like your sight and ability to breath and walk on two legs
Excellent deal for $399 The story is great and not too sad despite both the main characters are teen angers with cancer Cannot wait for the movie
I loved this book I'm thirteen and I thought I was so touching I think about how hard it was to lose those things and now I love life so much more
This is the best book I've read in a long time If i had the time i would have finished it in one day although i didn't want it to end I'm 25 and I haven't read a 'young adult' book since maybe middle/high school and i loved it I was immersed in the story since the first chapter John Green is an amazing writer I found myself re-reading some sentences and dialogue because they were absolutely brilliant The bad reviews on here don't really make any sense Sure they don't talk like normal 16 year olds and if they didwhat would the book be It wouldn't be anything It's different and that's what I LOVED about it It wasn't meant to be realistic I can agree with some people on the Peter Van Holten plot (especially towards the end) and the fake cigarette thing but still a great book that I will definitely read again
I rarely say that you have to read a book since tastes and genres run the whole gamut but I'm saying that you have to read this book This book left me quaking with sadness even though there are moments of lightness In the ten days it took me to read this novel I couldn't wait to get stuff out of the way so that I could curl up with THE FAULT IN OUR STARS in the evening I delved into a world of cancer frailty strength humor the meaning of life and the legacy people leave behind when they pass on With other books I find the focus may be on a few things or a singular theme but this book seems to encompass so much more It's as if John Green held up his arms to life itself to encapsulate its pith and put it in this book with two characters Augustus and Hazel who will capture your heart and won't let go
I've just finished reading The Fault in Our Stars I've had the book since its release but decided to wait until I had the time to give the attention it deserves It was hard to stay away from spoilers but I'm glad I managed to do it quite successfullyThis is one of those books that as soon as you start reading you know it's a rare thing The stars align and it all works I'm deeply touched by the story the characters the discussions and the way John presents these very complex thoughts with tender simplicity It flows beautifullyI can't recommend it enough Actually I purchased copies of the book and gave them to some of my closest friends so as to make sure they'll read it It meant a great deal to me and I'm sure it'll mean a lot to everyone who takes the time to discover it
A book that makes you think about life and death An honest portrayal of fighting disease A testament to love and all the magic that comes with it
Great writer who rips your heart out with his cleverly written words and beautifully developed characters all whom you wish were part of your life
This book made me cry in spots  and laugh too And now I'm going to see if the book within a book exists and read that too for Hazel and for Gus
much like good kings bad kings written by Susan Nussbaum this book will entertain you from start to finish  well worth the time to read
The story of Gus and Hazel Grace is one that I will always carry with me The book is so intense and full of feeling Definitely highly recommended
Very sad but heartfelt look at young lives and their families affected on many levels by cancer  I would definitely read more works by this author
Prepare for tears Lovely although heartbreaking Great character development Can't wait to see the on screen adaptation I'm sure it'll be great
The book opens eyes to make people realize there are sick dying people and to be thankful and blessed for what they have The book is very touching
I couldn't put this book down I look forward to reading more of his books I like books that make you feel something and this book did just that
Such a great book Love it it was so good I recommend it to everyone John green is such a good writer and there is nothing better than this book
I as many others have seen the movie but once again book was better I couldn't stop reading Made me cry as did the book Recommend anyone to read
It was a very good and interesting book I got sucked into it and I just couldn't stop reading it no matter what I tried I definitely recommend it
I like it  Touching story of young adults  with cancer  their battles with their disease and falling in love  A very real and honest prospective
This book is such an good and inspiring book If you are an emotional person like i am you will cry like I did This is my all time favorite book
The perfect balance of romance tragedy and laughter I truly enjoyed it and loved that it made me face mortality within the confines of the story
Written very intelligently After shying away from the movie previews I found out John Green wrote the book  I read it within 3 days and loved it
Simply amazing This book was awesome I connected with the characters immediately I am looking forward to reading more from John Green Well done
This was very well written I loved this book Although make sure you have some tissues right next to you I cried throughout the end t of the book
Stupid book made me cry a million times Definite page turner and I finished it in a day I enjoy the different perspective and somber character
this is such a refreshing storybeautifully written the story of Augustus and hazel brought tears to my eyes I truly enjoyed reading their story
It is a standard teen romance but goes deeper into the emotions and the power of the human spirit to have an illness without the illness having you
I enjoyed the book although it was heartbreaking depressing I just expected more of an ending I suppose though it is meant for a younger audience
I bought this for a gift that was requested I haven't given it yet so not fair to rate However the book came in a very timely manner and was new
Took some time to get to know the personality of characters I like to be able to identify their traits so that their behaviors work with the story
I loved the irreverence of the main character the way she scoffs at the cliches of a terminal illness Read it but don't sit down without tissues
I chose a five star review because this book is like the reality of life  It tells you about how cancer can't get in the way of you doing anything
This book was brilliant It broke my heart made me laugh and most of all made me appreciate everything I have and changed some of my views on life
Not a cancer book Romance With a hint of brilliant and inspiring life lessons My favorite thing is how accepting they are with the idea of death
I heard about this book from a friend who couldn't praise it enough Now I've suggested this book over and over with just as much praise Loved it
I love  this book so much it is filled with every emotion imaginable I was never really into romance but this book I think everybody could enjoy
Easy read great story deeper then one would expectI thoroughly enjoyed traveling through Hazel and Augustus' story of true and fleeting love
I wanted to read the book before I saw the movie didnt turn out how I expected Well written and a truly beautiful story about life love and loss
This book was very inspirational and thoughtful I loved it It's as if the author himself was the main character The way he detailed the feelings
Read the book even if you have already seen the movie I finished it within a day and cannot wait to start Looking for Alaska Beautifully written
Kept me engaged~ I couldn't put it down because I wanted to know what was going to happen A lot of truth and emotion was felt throughout the story
My  daughter wanted to read this book before she went to see the movie  She is up late every night because she just cant put it down She loves it
Great book written with a feeling and sensitivity  Captivates both yong and older adultsDifficult to put down  Enlightening and meaningful
This was a very good book I enjoyed John Green's style of writing It had all of the right amount of humor and romance and existential questioning
Yes I cried and smiled and wanted to hug my children and grandchildren  I see why so many have read this book  Thanks for the such great reading
I enjoyed this book because it portrayed real friendships and the real life affects that cancer can cause I have already recommended it to friends
Amazing love story Perfect amount of cheesy and realism Can't wait to reread and share this book with the world This is my Imperial Affection
This book is very good but also sad You might want some tissues and you should definitely see the movie too Only problem big words to understand
Author very perceptive of situation  The book held my interest throughout and am looking forward to seeing the movie which is getting good reviews
It's a very touching story keeps you interested the entire time Definitely appeals more to teenage group and adolescents Still a wonderful story
I am a romantic person This is a romantic book but not romantic enough to make me cry I was so hoping to cry my eyes out Anyways is a good book
good storyfilled with life lessons regarding terminal illness  this is a quick and easy read  highly recommend reading before seeing the movie

I would read this book over an  over again It tells of a girl struggling to survive against cancer and how heroic an  strong she is while doing it
This  was such a good book I couldn't put it down it took me less than a day to finish John Green writes with a style that you fall in love with
This was a really good book some things I quite could not understand But a love story a very sad love story but you won't regret reading this book

Thoroughly enjoyed the story about cancer that wasn't about cancer Beautiful character development and I couldn't help but feel a sequel is needed
Augustus is not dead He lives in our hopes and dreams Most importantly our aching hearts Though I've said it I don't really hate you John Green
The book was good  I found it to be different from what I expected but I wasn't disappointed  I won't read it again but I'm glad I read it once
Wonderful story Well written Heartfelt love that endured life struggles I was able to read this book in a day Loved the authors voice and style
This was  an amazing book everything added up I was worth reading and I can't wait to see the movie I recommend reading the book sooo worth it :)
A little practical could have seen that ending coming as soon as they mentioned it in the book they read in the story But overall good story

Truly amazing story  The exchanges between characters were filled with humor and an incredible blend of  intellectual prose  Well done John Green
This book has to be one of the best books ever It's such a cute story between these 2 people who go through something tough but yet stick together
This book is fantastic and I would recommend it to anyone interested in romance novels with a little twist I only dislike that there is no more
Came across the book by accident  I guess there are no accidents  Great perspective on a life where fair is only a place where you eat corn dogs
but worth it  I had a hard time getting through the first 1/2 but I'm glad I did  this book gives you a different look at life and I loved it
I loved it Death is such a difficult subject especially the death of a child from illness John Green handles the subject with dignity Beautiful
Just when you thought you heard it all two young teenagers fall in love It is definitely a tearjerker every step of the way Too hard to put down
My teenage daughter told me to read this book I'm so glad I did  Very very real I love the intelligence the author gives to his main characters

Fantastic book Excellent narration Touching unexpected point of view and lovely story Loved everything abut it Definitely one to keep rereading
This writing was a pleasure to read The love and thought poured into this book is felt in every word printed on the page John Green does it again
It was a very different approach to death and life Very clever and very funny It reminds all of us that even living can be a side effect of dying
Beautiful story about young love and the fault in their stars Enjoyed the parts of poetry and I do wish myself that I find a love that Hazel found
This book has some pretty amazing lines- I think I highlighted half of themsuper easy fast read with such a great message Loved every bit of it
I don't want to spoil it for you but you will need a lot of tissues when you finish the book look for forward to reading more of John Greens books
The best book I have ever read I loved it so much I would recommend this book to anyone who loves love stories and just beautifully written books
Read this book you will laugh cry and cheer Then cry some more It makes one realize the fragility of life and teaches us to savor every second
The story was so poignant and touching buy I cried through most of the second half of the book  But even tho I was crying I couldn't put it down
I completely adored this book but when it came to the end I just crawled up in my bed and cried Beautifully written with an amazing plot and tone
Poetic sad and full of wonderthe tragic characters in Green's The Fault in Our Stars will have you laughing and crying by book's end
Didn't want to put this book down This is the first book I've read by this author but if this is an indication of his style I'll be back for more
Desperately uplifting  This unconventional love story brought me to tears and deep thoughts a rare combination for a book Highly recommended
I loved this book my favorite character was Gus but the others were great too it really makes you think of all the real important things in life
Simply amazing I have never read a book like this It left me with a sense ofAnyone who has ever lost someone to cancer should read this
I rarely write reviews of books but I had to write one for this book It was one of the best books I've ever read To me it is absolutely perfect
One could not explain the greatness of this book John greens writing is unbelievable It is brutally fantastic By far one of my favorite books
I fell in love with this book from the first few pages I love the story it tells It will make you laugh cry and you will remember their story üíú
The book was later than expected but it arrived in perfect condition I am really excited to start reading I've heard s many great things about it
By far one of the best and most eloquently  written books anyone has the luck or chance to read Reading this book is not an option but a necessity
This was an easy read but it doesn't mean that it isn't meant for adults as well This is a great book for any age I cried I laughed and I loved
I really enjoyed this book I could feel the emotions of the characters and in some parts I cried I love this book and I would read it over and over
Fantastic I couldn't put it down John green writes with clarity and precision It's amazing how he can write from the perspective of a young girl
I enjoyed this book very much It is well written moving and very thoughtful Would definitely recommend this book to both teens and adults alike
This book was charmingheart-breaking and perfect An extraordinary book by an extraordinary author Recommended to all being known to the universe
While the book has a predictable plot the characters are fresh with realistic and clever dialogue Heart wrenching story that lingers in my memory
Though slightly depressing it was a very cute book which I very much enjoyed I would recommend it and look forward to reading more by this author
Very clever dialogue and not at all filled with self pity despite the sadness of the situation depicted Ultimately it emphasizes the joy of living
A reminder that a strong healthy body is a gift The characters eloquently faced their battles the universe handed them Painfully honest and real
I liked this book I don't think it was amazing but it was enjoyable It was a bit cheesy and unbelievable at times but a good read none the less
The Fault in Our Stars is a beautifully written book which completely changed my aspect on cancer patients and survivorsThe views expressed by Hazel and Augustus are genius but are almost unbelievably genius for people of their age I understand that they are supposed to be wise beyond their years but the complexity of their thoughts and relationship would be easier for me to believe even if the characters were two years older A minor detailI loved this book but even so it seemed rushed to me Green's Looking for Alaska and Paper Towns are written in perfect detail and bring you through twists and turns; The Fault in Our Stars was almost begging to be more freeHowever this is an amazing story with amazing perspectives overall
Be ready for a tearjerker - from start to finish  Sprinkle in a good dose of wry humor (about cancer and dying) and you have a great little novel
I liked this book for the story and for the characters  Several of the plot points could be tighter but overall a good read for just about anyone
Hated the fact that Augustus dies and at the end don't know Hazel 's fate in terms of living or dying But I guess the ending is very much implied
Interesting read  Being in the medical field it lead me down several paths My life my work views  Definitely helped me grow as a person/nurse
I don't read many story books and this one was amazing I consider myself to be pretty cold but this author touched a couple strings in my heart
A captivating well-written novel Difficult to put down but easy to pick up where you left off  Prompts self-examination  I highly recommend it
This was good I enjoyed it and it was a fast read I don't think I would see the movie though because I don't think it could live up to the book
beautifully written Very touching to read about young loveand how young people worry about their parents when they are fighting their own battle
What a great story with a thoughtful and respectable way to deal with death and dying I love how it ends Makes you want to contact the author h
I cannot say it was enjoyable but it is worth the read This novel gives a vantage point into individuals with terminal illnesses and disabilities
Very good writing You just get lost in the story I couldn't wait to finish but now that I am I'm sad that I have to search for another good book
I loves this book It's heart wrenching and a good eye opener for those of us that don't suffer from cancer Definitely recommend that you read it
easy read with a touching believable relationship between two great young people Talented author with an interesting take on the world of cancer
Wow Hits a nerve because it is many people's reality just sad people suffering these illnesses don't always get to experience such a great love
A really nice book well written  I read it in just a few hours as I really wanted to know the ending  I was a little surprised  Lots of  tears
This book was beautiful and magical on levels that most have yet to understand For the love shown and shared in this book was truly inspirational
One of the best books I've read lately I was glad I knew nothing about the book when I started reading it and now I can't stop talking about it
Loved this book I thought it would be a little juvenile but I enjoyed every minute of it Sharp wit and great humor despite a very serious plot
I fell in love with the characters and the story  It wasn't clich√© or sappy I see why this book touches a vast amount of readers it's believable
Not my favorite I think it is a teenager type of book and would not recommend for serious adult reading Wish had not wasted my money on this one
Very much enjoyed this book It was funny romantic sad and all around a great read Will definitely be reading it again I recommend getting it
Hope the movie is half as good as the bookWell written thoughtful and enjoyable I read this book in about a day Exceeded my expectations
I'd give it 3 and 1/2 if I couldI don't really care to say more than thatBut this thing says I have to write More than so many words
I love this book It is inspirational and sad and happy and beautiful at the same time I hope you like it as much as I did I read it three times
Great book  Characters were reality based and although you knew that death would be forthcoming it was handled appropriately and not with maudlin
Incredible Must read so completely real hilarious and heart-breaking Could not put it down If you liked My Sister's Keeper you'll love this
absolutely loved the book and pretty much anyone can read jt so I would recommend everyone My favorite part was when they were in holland so cute
I absolutely loved this amazing and very we'll-written book I can't use words to describe how great it was I loved it so much and I recommend it
John Green is a god among men  The Fault in Our Stars is beautifully written and the characters were impossible to not fall in love with Amazing
This book found a way to make me laugh and cry at the same time The witty banter between the main characters was so refreshing a real I loved it
This was amazing it spoke to me in more ways than 1 I don't have cancer but I do have heart problems and I can relate to her about being a grenade
Great read  Horribly realistic of a life with cancer in our children while hopeful of the life experience and joy they bring through the journey
The writing style was a bit annoying and the characters were pretty flat and shallow but it was easy to read and the overall story was pretty good
A beautiful love story written so wonderfully I couldn't put itdown I am ecstatic to go see how it has been interpreted for the big screen
A must read to realize the truth about life To re-ground yourself And appreciate your loved onesExcellent book Really well written
Although I'm middle-aged and this book may have been written for teens I thoroughly enjoyed reading it  It is well-written and captures the mind

One of the most touching an  insightful books I have  ever readThis is a true work of art It is so captivating and I could not put it down
I enjoyed this book but dang  I felt a little manipulated  However I think it's largely because the characters are flawed but oh-so-likable
fantastically written and truly a moving literate piece of work love and deathall that life is composed of in our world of nonfiction fiction
I cried it was worth it though I'm glad it need the way it did I just wish I could have the courage to watch the movie and not ball my eyes out
Teenagers generally are not as well-spoken or read as these characters but I wish they were  There will be no sequel to this book just like AIA
John Green is a fantastic author  His characters are intellingent and witty  It was a fantasic story and the character development was fantastic
This book was beautifully writtenIt is simple and a cute read if you get attached to your characters too easily this is not a book for you
The story held my interest and although it was fiction and show a lot of real life reality  I would really recommend this short novel to teenagers
This is a beautifully tragic tale of two young lovers  Couldn't not put this down except to reach for tissues in order to wipe my weeping eyes
I loved this book although it was a a tearjerker Even more moving knowing that the author based it on his real-life friendship with a dying girl
I gave it a 5 star because the story wasn't all about fairytales but the author used vocabulary relationship right for young or old and religion

There is not much to say other than well done  This story was one that made me laugh cry feel emotions I didn't know I could from a book Bravo
I love to write There is no doubt about that And I definetly wasn't thrilled when my friend gave me a cancer book to read They are always so depressing And there is no doubt that this was but it wasn't the sad parts that inspired me The beginning parts of Hazel and Augustas falling in love; that's what really got me It just shows me that maybe one day I can write something half as decent as this I would be happy with that I will keep writing and will always keep John Green's writing in my memory in hope to be as good as him one day I recommend The Fault in Our Stars without a doubt; this was most definetly one of the best books I have ever read and maybe the best book I will ever read I am young younger then the main characters but I know an amazing book when I see it an amazing read
The Fault in Our Stars is a very special book I saw the high ratings and just had to order it to read and I so glad that I didThe two main characters in the story Gus and Hazel are both totally credible characters They are two young teens fighting against cancer and the story covers issues of how one might really feel if dealt the dreaded C-word It is tender heart-breaking humorous and just plain ol' down-to-earthGus is my favorite character because he has such a great sense of humor He reminds me of my brother-in-law when he was fighting cancer and the funny sayings that came out of his mouth I loved Gus for that reason and because he has such a tender loving heart Every girl would want such a guyI recommend this book to everyone young (teens) and old
I read it in one day It is intellectual witty touching relativating - simply beautiful Can definitely recommend it Makes you appreciate life

The fault in our stars is easily one of my favorite books Its beautifully written Its sad funny and frustratingly perfect It explores young love in its awkward sad heart warming and tragic states All the characters in this book are so amazing you can really relate to them and there emotions And just the way John Green writes is fabulous And Hazel Grace she is just the most amazing character You can really relate to her and her thoughts Her love for Augustus is outstanding and vise versa Oh did I mention how freaking hilarious this book is TFIOS has also taught me so much about life and love Also next time I want to egg someones car I know how(: I did not think a book could evoke so much emotion like this one did I will love this book till the day I die John Green is a true genius
Tedious it seems like every book of the genre is being made into a movie these days and shouldn't be
Once again John Green delivers a wonderfully captivating story filled with raw emotions and real charactersThis book is a must read
This book hit close to home because at the time I purchased it I myself was having health issues and had just been diagnosed with thyroid cancer
This book is an adorable read As an adult in the early 20's I enjoyed reading a book that actually felt like it was written by a real teenager
I saw the movie before reading the bookliked the movie so needed to read the book I am positive I will read more Of John Green in the future
Simply beautiful This well written book is funny serious and sweet True love happens when you least expect it The characters are delightful

I'm speechless but am grateful that John Green is not A wonderfully sensitive and relevant and applicable storyfor the living and the dying
I love how much I could start reading and couldn't stop reading it I wish I could read it again and not remember what happens It is that good
Easy and fast read Loved the characters and how their story of life and death was told Loved how it could be serious and funny at the same time
This book gives you a lot of lessons to think about  When it comes down to it statistics are just statistics and you just have to deal with it
Enjoyed this easybut predictable book Quick read and pleasant story Characters were easy to connect with Looking forward to seeing the movie
a splendid deeply moving book with some tough-minded characters worthy of our love and our intelligent attention; and some beautiful sentences
It was a great book  Just great  It is so emotional for the characters involved and it is sort of a sad story but reading feels like it's not
I think this book propels a good story At times you will find yourself in tears but that's what makes it so good I highly recommend this book
Prepare yourself  It is life from the other side of the road the one where young people get ill and die  Nobody to blame just in their stars
This book was amazing and so is the authorI loved it and I wanted to read it again and again I just have three words to say IT WAS AMAZING
This is a story about a young lady who is dying of cancer she meet and young man who is falls in love with This book will make you laugh and cry
It was a book that filled with honesty and raw love and it was truly amazing to see a teenager be portrayed so realistic all in a fictional novel
It's heartwarming and heartbreaking John Green wrote beautifully and captured everything perfectly I enjoyed my little infinity with this book
Great book I couldn't put it down Green portrays death in a way that isn't scary but heroic  I can't wait to read another book by this author
I highly recommend this book Emotional thought provoking and not what you expect A good look into your soul to see who we really are Enjoy
This is a great book It made me cry but good books sometimes do that Definitely worth reading and of course it is much better than the movie
If you are in need of a good cry start reading this book It is a tear-jerker I liked the book but was emotionally exhausted after reading it
This book is an inspiring book for me I felt every emotion that was given and I hope that others will read this book and understand what I mean
AMAZING JUST READ IT Definitely one of my favorite books It makes laugh cry and it makes you reflex about pain &amp; loss John Green is a genious
Enjoyed this book and found it to be full of honest human emotion Did find some of  the plot points a little cheesy but all and all a good read
Captivating from the first page Couldn't put it down Intelligently written and gives a unique view into the mindset of a child battling cancer
A great and innocent love story of two kids who show what it means to love unconditionally Simple It has definitely become one of my favorites
From the moment I started reading it I could not put it down So easy to follow I immediately downloaded the sequel Highly recommend this book
I really enjoyed this book I thought it was well written and heart touching- one of those books that stay with you after you are done reading it
Was a very sad book good reading but not griping that you couldn't put it down  Makes you consider your own mortality and that of your children
this was a really good book some of my friends read this book and told me they loved it it would be really cool for the author to make a sequal
the author did an excellent job of showing a young love come to life I love the analogies and the out of the box thinking makes you think too
I'm giving this book a five for the beautiful story This book will make you cry a few times I see cancer in a different way after reading this
Amazing story A tear jerker for sure Yet it inspires you to truly treasure the simple things in life and to never take your health for granted
Is a great book  I loved everything about it I would recommend this to all of my friends an  I can't wait to see the movie this is a perfect book
Ilove it and I wouldrecommend to kidsold enough tounderstand dying but young enough to care about the characters it's truly an amazing book
A good story of 2 youths perspective dealing with their cancer Keep a dictionary handy to look up vocabulary words OK for mature teens to read
This was a cute book but nothing extraordinary and definitely not some Wonderful love story I'd pass and just see the movie if your interested
Very well written  Happy  Sad  Thought provoking  Although considered a young adult (YA) book it does contain language and sexual content
Beautiful story love is so deep and life is so very precious  Recommend this book easy readyou'll cry and fall in love with the characters
The Fault in Our Stars is a truly sad yet hopeful book I would recommend it to anyone because I'm sure that even though it's sad it's good
Can you say reading about cancer and teenagers up lifting Well yes because of their positive attidue against their fight and still havea life
Well written a tragedy laced with humour emotion loss and disappointment It's a roller coaster ride that will make you laugh as often as cry
This book will break your heart but its totally worth it It's well written  thoughtful and smart and you will fall in love with Augusts Waters
It's a bit of a tear jerker but beautifully written Makes you see the other side of things and appreciate  your life and health a little more
Amazing book loved it from start to finish Sad in parts but had so much meaning to it I wouldn't recommend people of all ages to read it
It would be impossible to read this book without becoming engrossed in the lives of the two main characters  It's a moving and captivating book
I really enjoyed reading this book and felt it was very well written Much better than the movie that just came out but that's usually the case
I love this book I kept crying about Augustus and what happens to him at the end Don't want to spoil it for others who haven't read this book
Enjoyed this Excellent character development Really felt the¬†relationship between these two teens and their third companion cancer Well done
Tear jerker So sad but so well written It makes want to cuddle my son and never let go because we don't really know how much time we will have
This book is so beautifully written I cried many tears but will take with me the message of true love and being thankful for each and every day
I could not put this well written book down It was inspiring and touching Like the character herself  I had to find out what happened to them
Beautifully honest Meaningful beyond the words written on the page True testament of love life and death Best book I've read in a long time
Basically I am in love If only we can all be so lucky as to find our own Augustus Waters Only hopefully to live past the young age of 18
Wanted to read the book before I saw the movie and was curious about the title  Got my answer and probably won't see the movie  Easy read:))
I love this so much it is a tearjerker but I love the romance Gus and Hazel and just wonderful characters that I fell in love with for the start
I enjoyed the book It was an easy read held my interest I think was well-researched and the author did a good job establishing the characters
This book was an amazing story about love and cancer  How much it effects so many peoples lives  True happiness and unfortunate disappointment
Awesome So suspenseful and an unexpected ending but it was powerful It was an interesting story about Hazel I want to go and see the movie
Cutest and the most saddest book I have ever read It was very well written And you can tell that hazel and Gus have a strong pull between them
Nice phrasing and English language management Destined to be a favorite of young teens for decades Looking forward to the authors next reality
I chose this rating because of the predictability of the ending  if I'd seen the movie without reading the book I would have been disappointed
If I could describe this book in one word it would be: beautiful It is so well written and very moving Wonderful read I didn't want it to end
This book hooks you It makes you root for the young couple and it makes you laugh out loud and cry for them Worth every penny and every second
I laughed I cried I yelled all signs of an excellent read which this most certainly was Just be preparedthere are more tears than laughter
Great book about how love can triumph regardless of the unfortunate circumstances Such a tear jerker but opens your mind to a new point of view
I read this because my son recommended it   I enjoyed reading it but was saddened by the hopelessness of the characters concerning an afterlife
I read this book not knowing what to expect But as I read it I was immediately brought into a world of sickness and love and pain and triumph
There was something slow and easy in the way this book moved so that despite sad content I consistently felt drawn in and uplifted  Beautiful
I have never loved and hated a book as much as I love and hate this book After reading it for the second time it's still as amazing as the first
I read this so I could go see the movie It was a fantastic book that I highly recommend Will definitely be exploring more of this authors work
I liked that it wasn't about cancer and death but rather about life Well doneI'll read it again and recommend it to anyone and everyone
I was absolutely speechless the entire book I guess you could say that my thoughts are stars i cannot fathom into constellations Wonderful book
It made me think of my own perspectives dealing with my own terminal cancer And how it is hard for others to deal with it as positively as I am
I loved everything about this book every little piece ties in with another And at the end it's a story you'll want to read over and over again
This book is amazing Read it:)I would suggest teenagers and older to read itIt's a sad book but very touching and worth the read
Tissues are needed at the end Great quick read that really pulls at your heart strings and makes you realize there's still good left in people
Was a very good book  Was not happy with the way the book just ended Other then that it was better then expected Cannot wait to see the movie
I'm speechless really My heart wants to be broken but it was so sweet and eye opening that I'm not all that sad anymore Great job John Green
This is one of the best books I've ever read And I know it will be one I read over and over again I recommend this book to anyone with a heart
Even though I saw where this book was going from the beginning I just couldn't put it down  I finished it in 2 days &amp; it was such a great read
Smart funny &amp; painfully sad  I would recommend this book for young adults &amp; up  Curl up with this book and a box of tissues  worth the read
So Good  I Read It Over And OverBest Book Ever You Must read this no matter what happens You MustI Loved It
Great read  Wonderful mix of humor in the midst of such possibly dismal circumstances Well written and hard to put down once you begin reading
It was so good and I cried and it was just so fantastic can't wait for the movie Definitely recommend it I will always love this book
I love this book I cried I laughed I recommend this book to everybody and hope people read it I can't believe it's a movie too like wow
I can't tell you the number of times I laughed out loud and cried the next  I loved the sparkling sharp dialogue and the tearing of your heart
I don't not enjoy read that much but when I find a good book I have no problems reading it I balled my eyes out as I read this book in two days
TFIOS really made me FEEL I couldn't stop cryinglaughingfeeling What more do you want from a book I recommend it to anyone and everyone
One of the best authors of our time heartwarming devastating absolutely beautiful piece of art I have re read it more times than I can count
Although the story line became a little predictable towards the end I thoroughly enjoyed this book  It will definitely tug at your heartstrings
I wish this book were double it's size so I could read more I couldn't put it down &amp; finished it in one day but now I'm disappointed it's done
This was a beautiful story The dialogue was a bit unbelievable considering the ages of Gus and Hazel but it was beautifully written nonetheless
When I first picked up this book I feared the book was about cancer  It is not  A beautiful story of selflessness love and healing  Loved it
This book was so amazing It's a heartwarming story about hazel and her friend Gus who find a relationship and I can't spoil it Just read it
It was an interesting novel I liked how Hazel and Gus' story was a sorta love/try to survive cancer story w/o being the stereotypical love story
I'm not a fast reader but I read this book in 2 days  I've never cried when I read a book but I cried for hours on this book Love This Book
Amazing I couldn't put it down You connect with Hazel from the first page Such a true to life love and life story  Cannot wait for the movie
I have never cried so fast and wholeheartedly  I will recommend this book to everyone I meet  It has truly become my favorite book of all time
Beautifully written There isn't much more that I can say about this book other then I enjoyed it  I was hooked from the first page to the last
Loved the dialogueKept the story interesting for such a serious topiccharacters were engaging and likeabledef worth your time for sure
this book will make you smileand then make you cry your eyes out But most importantly this book will touch your heart in all the right ways
I had heard many good things about this book and I am so glad i read it  finally It took me two days of non stop laughter  joy pain and tears
Beyond words A beautiful story Could not put it down Must read I know it is Young adult fiction but I think every adult should read it too
This is a must read - not just for those who have friends or loved ones with cancer  It is a beautiful story of pure and true love and devotion
Some swearing but soo good I loved it I craved reading this book Fantastic job John Green I'd recommend it to teens and young adults mainly
this is the best piece of literature I have ever read highly recommend it to 13+ year olds you have not lived until you have read this
but a wholly positive take on life and death  i would highly recommend this book especially to anyone who has been roughed up by Life recently
A beautiful and unique love story that everyone should experienceA book that will lift your spirits and break your heart at the same time
The story of teenagers suffering from cancer is told from a new and original angle Characters are convincing and authentic I enjoyed this book
It's a good story It won't blow your mind but it's quite recommended It's serious when it has to be and funny in some parts An enjoyable read
This book was heavily recommended to me shortly after I discovered the internet phenomena known as Vlogbrothers (and their offshoot channels) (far too late I might add) The Fault in Our Stars is John Green at his finest I can say truly that I have not cried as hard or as long reading any other book in recent history; however that is not to say that this is a sad book (it is) Green's lightning wit and never-ending plethora of clever dialogue along with wonderfully sculpted characters give this book something above and beyond- a thing greater than the sum of its partsI can write congratulatory nonsense in this review all day but that does not change the fact that The Fault in Our Stars should be read By you Buy it The Kindle version is lovely
I love this book it was meant too be a school project but now it my favorite book Its sad and romantic and funny I really recoment this book
This is an amazing book It represents the real meaning of true love I cried but most of all it made smile and wanting the story to never end
I thought it ended quite abruptly but then again I couldn't think of a better ending Brilliant author Will definitely read more of his works
Very good book Actually the first time ever I've ever read a book after already seeing the movie This will definitively be on my re-read list
I read the whole book in one day I didn't want to put it down I was sad at the end but he did a great job conveying the characters to the read
Wow This book was amazing I am so glad I did not watch the movie I chose to have my heart broken by reading this book and I am so glad I did
I resisted reading this book having been afflicted with a cancer death in my own family I finally did read it and found it tragically wonderful
Loved how the author wrote It was great to see his feelings portrayed through writing I thought the characters were developed really well too
This book teaches lessons that not many will learn  I touched me in a way that I have never been touched  To truly understand you must read
This book touched my soul It was really not like reading a bookmore like eavesdropping on someone's life Please read You won't regret out
Loved the characters  They were real and deep  Well written with lots of thought about living in the universe  Can't wait to watch the movie
Great book Very gripping till the very end I don't know whether I should've cried or not but the world is excellently explained in this book
For anyone that has not seen the movieit is right in line with the book  Just a few artistic changes but nothing to distract the storyline
Nicely written book  Really gives great insight into the world of teens with cancer  Really brought out an emotional response from the reader
epic love storyrelatable even without cancer the movie was a great visual that did the book justice every girl deserves an Augustus Waters
Since this book is made into a movie I expected a bit more it's a good story just not exceptionally memorable Very good character development
I loved every ounce of this story It broke my heart while making me laugh and gives you this beautiful and interesting view on life with cancer
Good hshahahahhahaahhahahahahahah hshahahahhahaahhahahahahahah hahaha haha haha Hana Shaman haha Hana Hana haha haha Hana ha a Hana ha aha USA
Great read that also give you some insight on what it's like being diagnosed with a disease and how others tend to treat those people
Book is an easy read and the story is so good that you will not want to put down  Read the book and then go to the movie  They are both great
This book is amazing and the quality of the book was great however unfortunately my sister just spilled cranberry juice all over it and so ya
This book really reminds you how short and fleeing life is It makes you value good health and understand those with bad health a little better
Well written with some great linesYou don't get to choose if you get hurt in this world but you do have a choice in who hurts you
üòòüò≠üëåthis book was outstanding a pure work of art I can't wait to read more John Green books  Yours truly  Holland Spessard Sykes
Characters seem a bit emotionally sterile at the start but find some depth halfway through  Ending better in book than movieworth finishing
I will never get enough of this book I will read it over and over again just like Hazel Grace read An Imperial Affliction over and over again
Great read for the whole family Even if you saw the movie don't hesitate to open the book as the book diggs much deeper than the movie Enjoy
This book was good in that it shares that even though people have an illness they are not that illness they are people have feelings opinions  
I have never read  a book so fast It was absolutely amazing Best book I've ever read I will most definitely be reading more John green books
This book was beautiful heartwarming and makes you truly realize what is important in this world Read this book You won't be the same after
This book is the best teen love story there isHeartbreaking ending enough to make the manliest man cry Hopefully the movie is the same
What a wonderfully descriptive book  Could not put it down  Recomment all to read it  Bring the kleenexas you read it tears will come
Incredible Wonderful Nonstop comedy and tragedy throughout the book Can't say how much the connection between Hazel and Augustus effected me
This book is a great emotionallove story book It has so much emotion I started to cry a little but out of all that sadness there is happiness
Moving and thoughtful story line  Left me wanting to know more about the characters outside of their illnessesRequires a box of tissues
Cancer as it is and how this disease affects the lives of two young people  The story describes the emotions about the devastating loss of life
Grate book Will definitely have you crying by the end didn't see some things coming but other things you could tell where coming from the start
Great book that is a little more than you would expect This book will take you through an emotion roller coaster you never would have imagined
Good book Once I started reading I couldn't put down This book made you feel like you really knew the characters and were a part of the story
Excellent book A good taste of real life that appeals to young teens willing to depart from the fantasy lit that fills most of their book cases
Great book It will sit with me for a long time Only reason why I gave 4 instead of 5 is that I don't like sad books This one is a tearjerker
This book is the titanic of this generation I would suggest this book to anyone who loves romance stories and books about real life situations
It's a sweet story but I think it was way oversold to me so my anticipations were high Predictable teenage love story I did still cry though
Beautifully heartbreaking I wish I could go back in time and read it again I wish I could tell them to hold on to each other and never let go
OMG the book as so goodIstarted crying twice and the note was so sweet I felt I was watching the story not reading it It was AMAZING
I loved this book it is beautifully written and was hard to put down  Very much worth reading  I read a lot and this one is high on my list
Loved this book but like the story within the story I wish the ending would have been a little longer I kind of felt like  I was left hanging
Could not put this book down Great for all ages but as a 24 year old it meant a lot more Amazing book *warning may bring tears to your eyes*
who enjoys having their heart repeatedly ripped out of them and then crammed backing in over and over with a warm fuzzy feeling the whole time
I enjoyed it It made me happy and sad  I work with cancer patients and saw many similarities I feel this book will help me be a better nurse
I did speed through this book but felt the vocabulary was really really over the top in general and even more so for sophomores in high school
This Is Probably The Only Book That Has The Ability To Change My Mood From Happy To Sad And Everything In Between It's Beautiful It Really Is
Characters are so real so well developed  Couldn't wait to pick it up  Instantly involved rode thru the ups and downs all through the story
Great bookbut the ending just abruptly stoppedfor me I thought there was more to the story I guess not Definitely a page turner
It took me a couple of chapters to get hooked but then I couldn't put it down  Scars People should hope they are worthy enough to leave scars
I have no tears left I cried for the last two hours of reading - tears of utter loss and those tears literally created stars within the words
Break out the tissues it's your classic cancer tear jerker This book will really touch your heart especially if you've lost someone to cancer
I absolutely love this book It's funny romantic and tragic the ending is so well written and I nearly cried so hard Best Book ever written
A quick read Times of audible laughter and times of watering eyes I enjoyed the story even if it was a bit more emotional than my usual picks
Incredible I laughed and cried through the whole thing What a life changing book If you are looking for a new book completely recommend this
Great read Couldn't put the book down very intelligently put together  They cover this sensitive topic so well Can't wait to see the movie
I loved this book it was inspiring emotional and had amazing analogies finished it in less than two days think I'll read it again in a week

AMAZING this book is genius john green is genius This book makes you laugh and cry it's amazing and i would actually read it all over again
Great story Happy and sad at times Makes you think  about life and appreciate what you have A day to day struggle that you have to deal with
the good ones always die-I thought it was sweet love story- intelligent kiddos and had humor to the book too- loved IsaacGreat read
This was tragically beautiful in both the story and the way it was written To feel love no matter the length of time is a gift in and of itself
Wonderfully told story Can't wait for the movie Hope the ending is just as good as the book Looking forward to how they present the dialogue
May whomever reads this book appreciate the love story between Hazel and Gus it is truly touching and should be excepted  thank you John Green
I did enjoy some aspects of the book but wasn't something I just couldn't put down The love story between the two main characters lacked spark
Really touching and beautiful without being corny Augustus is one of the best characters I've read Felt very real and I would read this again
So beautifully written Everyone should get the chance to read this novel Gracefull Tragic Heartbreaking Lovingüíó It's the best book
This is an awesome bookI really like how you think something is going to happen but then the whole story flips and something else happens
It's amazing I fell in love with Augustus You simply don't understand and realize how much a book character means to you until they're gone
Its beautiful and heartbreaking not going to lie the hype of this book lives up to its expectations This made me cry and laugh at the same time
Its a little slow to start but ends up being a great read Heard the movie would be made soon hope it doesn't ruin the simplicity of the story
A sweet and tender love story about teenage love and loss and an insight into what it feels like to have Cancer impact you and those around you
Intelligently written &amp; beautiful executed the dialogue is humerous &amp; witty Many times throughout I was laughing &amp; crying at the same time
The fault in our stars is truly outstanding It is a must read for everyone There are some ups and downs but still heart warming and touchinng
This is a book that is written very differently than others Very touching and sad yet an eye opener to the different ways you can look at life
Excellent book Loved the character development and Relationships that developed throughout the story Would love to read more from this author
The fault in our starsNot my normal read or authorgreat story get your tissues out for this one  Had a hard time putting this one down
This beautiful heart raking tear jerking novel was the best I've read In a while It was written perfectly the perfect ending It's brilliant
This book just left me speechless it was just so sad but amazing This book really just hits your heart and makes you appreciate things more
I really didn't want to read this but I had to after I read the sample really good read  not hopeless at all left me with good deep thoughts
Made me look a little harder at everything around me Everything and everyone should be noticed And we should say when someone matters to us
What a great book Once i started reading I was hooked and couldn't put it down It made me laugh and cry I can't wait till the move comes out
I love everything John green well done I don't know what to do with my life but defiantly not waste it Especially when it comes to love
Unsentimental but deeply touching story Highly recommend to everyone The subject matter is grim and distressing but I wouldn't have missed it
This book is beautifully written  this  Will make you have at least 1 tear in your eyes but it's completely worth spending your money Trust me
Challenging read if you are empathetic but an extremely valuable one and one that is well written so that you are compelled to finish the story
I'm an adult with a soft spot for a good YA read This was recommended by a friend who shares my love for YA fiction and it did not disappoint
Simply amazing I'm at a lost for words I fell in love with Augustus just like Hazel and felt as if I was connected to them in some crazy way
Smiles laughs and tears A true young love story of two people fighting to live Beautifully written and wish I had more of this story to read
This is life put into a novel Thank you for showing us that John Green You are the poet that helps us understandLove Madison L Hasley
This was an amazing book I cried for most of it Don't read it in public if you don't feel comfortable crying in font of people Read this boo
All I have to say is this book has officially destroyed  any emotion I had left after this year's tragedy s but I greatly appreciate this book
This book is really great I enjoyed every minute and couldn't put it down It takes you on a journey and makes you rethink things A must read
I absolutely loved this book very beautifully written and the way Mr Green has expressed his character's views is quite remarkable  love it 
I fell in love with this book right away I recommend it It's perfect for teens and it helps them realize what they have and how lucky they are

It's an amazing yet sad book it's very touching in my opinion hazel and Augustus live the fairy tale I wish I could green did an awesome job
I loved The Fault in Our Stars because the characters were amiable the plot never took a minute to dwindle and the book was very well written
Hazel Grace is a lovely character who inspires you with her honesty  Thought provoking story of life love and loss that somehow radiates hope
I really enjoyed this book A young woman is diagnosed with cancer Sounds like a bummer But it was handled beautifully  I highly recommend it
This book describes me almost perfectly I see the world in a different way now And I hope to find and Augustus waters somewhere in this world
This was a great and entertaining book It was clever compassionate sweet and gave a great observation on how people with cancer are treated
Perhaps because I have seen my grandson through cancer this book was especially heart wrenching It was poignant but not overtly manipulative
Amazing bookTugged at my heart th  whole timeMust readGreat till the very endI look forward to reading more of his books
I loved this book I don't suppose I will really understand what the characters in the book go through but it gave me a perspective I never had
It was interesting that it is written from a girl's point of view by a male author  I think he did a good job with this  It held my attention
Book was okay it should be advertised as more for  a younger (16-22) audience - or maybe it is and I didn't notice Good character development
Oh my god I am currently a 6th grader and this book amazed me I am speechless I really am READ IT READ IT NOW DROP EVERYTHING AND READ IT
This is seriously one of the best young adult books I've ever read John Green is an awesome person and this is certainly his best work to date
An excellent read with bits of everythingromance happiness sadness triumph and failure I Will definitely retread this amazing book again
I am not a crier but this book cut into me I love this book with all my heart If you ever get the chance to read this I highly suggest you do
This wasnt a bad book but i didn't cry like everyone else said i would I'm used to reading Lurlenne McDaniel books they made me cry this didn't
Beautiful story about kids being kids with something extra to contend with It should change a reader's perspective on what's important in life
This book was beautifully written My niece read it and insisted I read itI'm glad I did It made me laugh and made me cry It was perfect :)
There were so many ways it could of ended much better but it was still a great story-very different and I like the perspective it is written in
An interesting love story I liked the relationship of the main characters with each other and their families It is  sweet sad and memorable
Considering this product came from DE and I reside in MD I got it within 2 days The book is in excellent conditionI'm very satisfied
All I can say is I just finished this and am going back to the beginning and starting over Many laughs and many tears Worth every tissue ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è
I enjoyed reading this inspiring book in spite of its painful subject The two teenager facing ubiquitous death threat are amazingly inspiring
I loved the book couldn't put it down Recently lost my sister-in-law to leukemia so it touched my heart and helped heal a little part of me
Love this book I read it a while back and was just able to post this I must say like most books it was way better written than on a screen
Loved this book  Did not see the twist at the end coming at all  Would highly recommend even to individuals older that audience written for
I really enjoyed his writing style I also enjoyed having to look up quite a few words  It is a great book about life and love and friendship
Such a beautiful sad and pure story I loved it so much üëèüôåüòÄüíôüò¢üòç Highly recommended for anyone who loves a lovely tragic love story üòÇ
It was a good book I enjoyed the plot I enjoyed characters but after hearing such rave reviews about it I was quite disappointed by the ending
I enjoyed this book immenselyeven the sadness of it I thoroughly recommend it The author knows well how to engage readers in his story
Glad I read the book and didn't opt for the movie A lovely story to read and be reminded that there is always someone worse off than yourself
I think this book gives great life lessons don't forget your tissues girls I also can't wait to read more I hope he comes out with a other book
After reading the book my husband and I watched the movie  Even though I knew the ending I was still welling up with tears  Very good read
Beautifully written Heart moving Real account of what cancer takes from families lovers and friends I hope the movie is as good as the book
I unfortunately saw the movie before reading the book However I cried even more Such a beautiful story about loveloss and life on between
Ugh What and amazing book I loved it and I cried like a baby I also watched the movie and as always the book is way better than the movie
I loved every word Gosh Of course it was sad once Augustus' PET scan lit up I'd hoped for a better outcome for him The ending was sweet üòç
The best book ever I recommend it to every girl and every guy who is kind hearted I want you to really read it carefully and take it to heart
so well written  a sad story but told with such heartfelt honesty  you can't help but falling in love with the 2 main characters in the book
Recommended by trusted sources this was a great story and an easy read As a mother I found this story touching and brought a tear to my eye
I love this book because well let's just put it this way- if a book can make me cry it is a pretty good oneThis book changed my life
This book goes far beyond your average cancer or love story it makes you feel so happy at point and sad at others I prefer this to the world
NOTHING I Hated The best book I have ever read Read this book if you are prepared to not only read their journey but go through it with them
Not a happy book but then we knew the ending before we started I did find it very insightful as to what they go through on a day to day basis
Reading it right now Enjoying it Saw a commercial for the movie wished I hadn't wasn't how I envisioned the characters to look like at all
terribly sad story about two young cancer patients and the loving relationship that forms between then during the everyday struggle with cancer
Not many books get me binge reading - but I could not stop reading this one until I had finished and then I was sad that it was over
It is a very easy book to read and to stay interested in  A sad story but also a little uplifting about the attitudes of the main characters
best book i ever read Cried so much but loved it to the movie was amazing and so many tears  i insist you read this book and watch the movie
Very good book but don't read the last few chapters on a plane with no tissuesunless you don't care about wiping your nose on your sleeve
easy readthis book made me feel like I was part of the story which drew me in to keep reading because I wanted to know what happens next
the fault our stars is a great book more people should read it I will read it again soon so I you ever read this you need the book it's amazing
I cried I kept reading I cried more And I got mad knowing what I thought would be a sad ending was awaiting mebut I couldn't put it down
Anyone in the world can relate This book is not about cancer it is about life love and not getting hung up on the everyday boredoms Enjoy
Enjoyed the book  I would not recommend teens reading it due to the language and sexual nature Overall I found it hard to put the book down
A sweet love story with a twist This will definitely get your YA kid reading and talking about what is going on with Hazel Grace and Augustus
Such a moving and intelligent novel I laughed and cried with the progression of the characters and would highly recommend this read to anyone
I was afraid I would need a box of tissues next to me while reading this  However it is tastefully done and I only needed tissues in the end
it is a book with meaning especially for the people who are suffering from cancer the book is written berry easy like in it is easy to read
Witty and moving Makes one admire the inner strength of the people who are actually living this experience Teaches you to live in the moment
Laughter tears and real lifeEmotional roller coaster that you need to be on Every one should read this to appreciate what they have
I liked the book I'm always up for a heart tugging love story I did not like the ending how it leaves you hanging on what happens with Hazel
I love this book I liked everything about it If you like love stories this book is for you That is because it is by far the best love story
Great writing Wanted to read before seeing the movie which I have no doubt will not live up to the book Thank you John Green for perspective
An emotionally engaging story of real life  Two teens who understand more about courage love heartbreak and loss then most adults ever will
I loved it It is a great love story that is sure to be a classic A modern trading of love in a world that doesn't promise anyone another day
This book will make you feel one thousand feels and the fantastic use of many allusions will leave u in tears by the end of this amazing novel
Love story about two illness stricken teens  Main characters are like able and entertaining Made me cry on more than one occasion Must read
I loved the writing style and the subject matter The main characters were very unique I am afraid the movie version is gong to be very sappy
I cried my way through this book like a little wimp I heard about it for the 9 thousandth time and finally decided to read it I'm glad I did
I enjoyed the immediate chemistry between the two main characters as well as their mutual friends  I liked the relationships with the parents
Great read touching accurate and heart-warming view of young love in some of the most challenging of circumstances Ready to see the film now
Absolutely beautiful Heart breaking but beautiful My daughter encouraged me to read this book and I'm glad I did Tissue paper is a must
This was a sad but uplifting read  Made you realize even though someone has a terminal illness they can still enjoy what time they have left
This is hands down the best book I have read in my entire life It is just amazing This will be the book that I will read over and over again
What a wonderful book Could not put it down and cried the entire time I would recommend this to anyone who likes a love story and a good cry
Amazing fantastic every parent should read this it will make u hug your kids closer  Very high recommendations Need my friends to read it
Teens to adults this is an excellent read Now I will see the movie There was emotional moments for me after recently losing my dad to cancer
Sweet but depressing too  Would recommend the book but I'm not going to see the movie  Enough is enough  Ready for an uplifting summer read
Fast read with good emotional ties to characters  Well written but generally predictable story line  should appeal to a young adult audience
this book was so sad and touching there were SO many parts when I bawled my eyes out I cannot wait to go see the movie read the book please
This story is amazing With so much crappy literature out there it is nice to read something great I am glad that I got to know Hazel and Gus
loved the writing althought no 16 year talks like that also hard to understand anyone getting so hung up on bookcould not stop crying
I'm usually a person of many words but all I can say is this: This book is completely worth the crushing heartbreak you feel while reading it
Wanted to read the book before seeing the movie I wasn't disappointed and while I found the story somewhat predictable I enjoyed the writing
This was well written with good characterizations  It was a little geared towards young adults but still enjoyable for older readers as well
The characters are full of depth and heart A very accurate portrayal of young people that teach us all the power of love hope and sacrifice
This book is about dying and living  The message is that we all die some sooner than others It is how we live that really matters after all
This book will make you laugh and make you cry But crying is just ONE EXAMPLE OF A METAPHOR A metaphor only Augustus Waters would understand
Relationships sometimes can only occur when they must occur and would never occur if the circumstances weren't perfect in their imperfections
How can I read a book in a day and fall in love with so many characters This book was delightful and sad and remarkableWonderous
So eloquently written  I love the ending  I can relate as a chronically ill person to the characters of Augustus and Hazelsimply wonderful
It is amazing It really is an aspiring story it makes you laugh and cry You just fall in love as if it were you instead of the characters
The reason why I gave this book a 5 star earring is because you can really relate to the characters so you the the same emotions that are felt
BEST BOOK EVERI LOVED ITIt was so touching and funny at the same time You might tear up a little but that's probably normal  :)
I couldn't put it down The way that Green embodies the mind of a teenage girl going through something as tough as cancer is truly eye-opening
Oh my gosh I read this whole book in technically five hours It was fantastic Now that the movie will be out soon I hope it too is as good
The book was amazing It truly touched me to read something so interesting and wonderful I'm defiantly checking out more books by this artist
Amazing not sappy well written heart wrenching but full of promise for those who struggle to know everyone leaves their mark in some sense
Amazing Amazing Amazingsimply Amazing I could not put the book down Keep some tissues nearby when reading as it is truly a tearjerker
Amazing Heartbreaking Inspiring This book made me laugh cry and truly be thankful for being blessed with good health Kudos to John Green
Good story and with all the sadness the author injected the perfect kind of humor To keep the reader reading  Can't wait to see the movie
Good story but kind of predictable Definitely recommend Reading for our book club right now  Will be interesting to see what they all think
I enjoyed this book and I think it is fine for a mature 14 year old like mine I especially liked Hazel and her clever quirky outlook on life
I Thought this book was great it had everything from love family sadness joy a little of everything Beautifully written loved the book
Excellent read Sensitive sad but beautiful story For young adults and old alikeCharacters are brilliantly drawn I laughed and cried
Loved this book so much So many great life lessons Easily became my favorite book Would and have recommend this book to anyone and everyone
Recommended to anyone with a heart this touching novel teaches you things about  life in a spectacularly emotional way You'll cry I promise
Enjoyed this immensely I have recommended it to everyone I have spoken to since reading it Wonderfully written story and charming characters
Awesome writing done with such truth Hazel and Augustus are teenagers we all met and knew and I loved watching them on their journey together
Sad ending but hopeful at the same time  So pleased it is being made into a movie  I suggest anyone needing a good read to pick up this book
Heart breakingly thought provoking  Worth every tear  So many wonderfully memorable commentaries on life love &amp; death for the young and old
This book was absolutely amazing It was so heartfelt and I congratulate John Green in his success of this book I cannot wait to see the movie
Haven't read a book this amazing in a long time  Highlighted so many lines that spoke to the heart  Made me look at life alittle differently
A awesome readThis book was too amazingI criedI'm just speechless This was just so omg This is outstanding
Dragged on and on at times An interesting story but I wouldn't read it againMost others really  enjoyed it  I'm clearly the exception
Exceptional book Witty and inspiring  Hits on the major life themes of what it means to live well and die well and handles both beautifully
Great book really enjoyed it Makes you think about what young people with cancer go through Breaks my heart to think about them with cancer
Every situation touched my heart It was lovely to read Every ounce of sadness was eventually transformed into joy Just absolutely wonderful
There was so much emotion when I came to this book its perfect and made me fall in love with John Green's writing I can't wait for the movie
Great story telling us how cancer patients really feel Made me laugh at the characters'unusual sense of humor and of course made me cry
Kind of like The Imperial Affliction I will not however travel to Indiana  I leave the ending as intendedand no spoil alerts just a hint
Best book of the century along with the divergent series I never would have predicted Augustus` tragic ending and how in love they really were
this book grabbed me from the moment I started reading and I didn't put it down until I was finished very touching love/life story easy read
Such an amazing story and the characters It's hard to not fall in love with them Heartwarming and heartbreaking at the same time I loved it
This book was an easy read funny and made me cry lots of times I definitely enjoyed reading it Also I really appreciated the way it ended
Makes me think that perhaps it does not matter when you die but makes you want to live and have a fulfilling life Wonderful real love story
Great message The characters although somewhat unrealistic grow on you  One of those books that you are happy you read and don't want to end
Very good book Loved every second of itIt was sad funny brilliantly written and truly epic  I will read more of his books for sure
I wish there was a sequel to this book and Gus didn't die so their story could keep going I guess I have to go on to the next book BYE :)
You feel immediately connected to the characters in this story Beautiful thoughtful powerful heartbreaking I can see why it is so popular
Such a beautiful love story coexisting alongside the honest reality of illness and sadness of dying young This book will stay with me forever
This book is full of emotion and spectacular writing You will definitely cry at the end John Green has really outdone himself with this book
Every once and awhile it's nice to read a story of unremarkable truth that is beautiful moving and more honest than most novels of this genre
Awesome book I loved Augustus and Hazel Grace character The author humor is sarcastic and great I loved it I recommend this book to everyone
I love john green this book only increased my desire to read more of his work I laughed and shed tears I recommend any of his work to anyone
Well written easy to follow touching story of love growing up and how quickly the tables can turn in life Can't wait to see the movie now
This is legit one of the best books I have ever read It is sweet heartwrenching tear jerking and absolutely amazing I highly recommend it
Amazing novel I put off reading it because I heard it was heartbreaking but beautiful I am so glad I read it although it brought me to tears
Just when you think you have a personality of a carachter figured out  they change  Sometimes it's confusing as to witch caracter is speaking
This book was amazing Of course great writing by John Green I couldn't put it down It took an unexpected turn but had a really nice ending
Good read I recommend  Very sad parts but gives you insight in the lives of teens with cancer Shows you the value of being healthy and live
This story made me cry it was beautifully written  It could have been longer really but that might just be because I didn't want it to end
This book is the best yet saddest novel I have EVER read John Green wrote this beautifully Beware that it will probably make you cry A lot
Never have I related so much to a book Thank you John Green for this great piece of literature Hazel and Gus' story really touched my heart
Just absolutely amazing Perfect magical and AMAZING I loved it and read it it is absolutely amazing Favourite book in the world by far
You will laugh you will cry &amp; you will turn the last page knowing full well it is a responsibility &amp; a gift to make the present moment count
I'm probably too old to read this book30's  I loved it though  It was an easy read and one that stuck with me for a while after I read it
This was a summer reading book for our daughter required by school  She liked it okay - may have enjoyed it more if it hadn't been 'required'
I loved this book  I will read it again when I am losing or have lost someone I love  The perspective on life death and love is wonderful
Although this is a novel for youth I found the messages quite adult  It will make you think about your own perspective on life  and death
This book is simply amazing I had heard raving reviews about it from friends for months prior to reading it and it certainly lived up to and exceeded expectations Before reading The Fault in Our Stars I read two of John Green's other books Paper Towns and An Abundance of Katherines Without having read Looking for Alaska yet I absolutely think this is John's best work I felt for the characters and was immersed in this world shown from the interesting perspective of a teenager with cancer She experiences a mix of depression realism hopefulness and optimism throughout the story The characters situations and story itself pose intriguing and insightful ideas I didn't want to stop reading it I feel very grateful to have read this novel and would recommend it to anyone
Holy guacamole that was one emotional roller coaster of a book I haven't read a book that tugged at my heartstrings as much as this book did in a very long time For as much as this book elicited feelings of joy it also brought me to tears and not the classy single tear rolling down the cheek cry but a full blown embarrassingly messy cryI went into this book with not-so-high hopes since I wasn't crazy about Looking For Alaska but I have to say that all my expectations were beyond exceeded Green's writing was consistent The plot was perfect The characters were real If you know anything about my style in books it's that these three things really make me tick Green absolutely nailed it and I can't express how glad I am that I gave his writing a second chance
The second I got the book I was so excited to start reading The beginning was great He writes like he talks on his vlogs so I could just imagine everything in his voice The middle got a little monotonous but I wanted to find out how it would end Then the end was amazing  To me the most important part of a book is the ending The last 50 pages is how I am going to remember a book and this was done very well At the beginning I thought I had the ending all figured out but this was much better  My favorite part about the book is how so many different little details and story lines are done well Reading it a second time and knowing how it ends just makes the beginning that much better to read overThe book itself I give 4*'s but John's awesomeness bumps it up to a 5
Absolutely loved this  Held my breath all the way through knowingbut would read it again easily  Nothing but admiration for this author
I love this book It's gripping story and amazing writing tool my breath away I recommend this book to anyone who can read you will love it
It realistically paints the tragedy of young love in the saddest of circumstances I would recommend this for middle and high school students
This was very beautiful The power it has is something like lightening in a bottle but also inevitable because of its ordained craftsmanship
I thought I read this book just to compare to the movie(which I have not seen yet) but I'm glad I read it Very good I could not put it down
This book Fault In Our Stars is the most romantic funny and adventurous all at the same time John Green has a gift and this book is stunning
I have never been into reading books but I read this in less then 3 days and I'm a guy and this book made me cry several time highly recommend
Beautifully written  I didn't want the book to end and when it does you just want to read it again in hopes that you'll learn something new
A surprisingly humorous book with a unique heroine And a quick read Makes you know one can be stronger and kinder if these short lives can
I haven't read in years and I'm not a good reader I enjoyed the story and had a hard time putting the book down I also found it easy to read
Loved this It's nice to find a book that allows the reader to experience the range of human emotions and you definitely experience them all
Very well written account of illness and how it affects everyone Great read for anyone either dealing with a loss or dealing with an illness
This book is one that stays with you after you finish reading  It's thoughtfully written and brings humor to a horrible disease  Great read
I loved this book it was a bit sad but nonetheless filled with wisdom Hazel and Gus are perfect and everything is perfect and I just love it
Of course it's great Bring on the Kleenex Got my teen daughter and 80-something mom to love it too Better than the movie Read it already
Makes you think about life a completely different way I cried quite a few times but it was a great book I would recommend to anyone to read
This was a great teen love story It is a big tear jerker and had me crying several times I really enjoyed it and was swept up in their love
so this book was a tear jerker for me at times really makes you appreciate life in some way or another such a good read Author has my vote
cancer sucks especially for kids this book shows that our choices do not have to let cancer win Hazel and Augustus win by loving each other
I watched the movie before I read the book But I will say that the book was just as easy to get into as if reading the book before the movie
Great read Wanted to read it before I watched the movie It's a beautiful realistically sad book I'm sure I'll read it dozens of more times
This book tells a love story of 2 people with cancer it just pulls you in and it makes you want to read it you never what to put the book down
I loved the crossing paths of stars that led to the greatest gift of all  love A deep sad and whimsical novel A journey I would recommend
One of my all-time favorite books  Emotional roller coaster  I laughed out loud reading one page and was in tears the next  Witty and wise
This book is awesome I would encourage boys or girls to read it I started it at 5:00 pm and finished at 3:00 am I just couldn't put it down
This is the only book that has ever made me cry and I've read tons of books It is an emotional book but well written and has a lot of heart
I loved the fault in our stars it has been the best book I have read in a long time  It was s  inspiring and I could never put if down 
At times sad but so many funny times as well Two people in love as deeply as any two people could love Well written and not sickening sweet
One of the best books I've ever read It is the rare novel that one minute your crying the next minute laughing I didnt ever want it to end
So many insights: pain that keeps hitting you waking to remembering the loss 2 seconds later Wonderful characters: I love all three of them
Beautifully written I have a friend at work who is just like Augustushe has cancer and going through chemoit really hit close to home
Amazing book easy readygrabs the heartmake sure you have plenty of tissues Couldn't put the book down Can't wait to watch the movie now
The allusions vocabulary lacking the ordinary and somewhat fanciful hint of a subplot were the dominant fascinations for meTeardrop
I really enjoyed this book I bought it on kindle for by daughter and ended up reading it myself I found myself bawling like a baby So sad
It was a great book But it was a little scratched so every time it would get to a good part  it would skip a couple seconds so frustrating
Since this was made into a movie I knew what the story was about  But I could not have guessed how a morbid story could be so enlightening
Finally a book that was more than the traditional light and fluffy summer read one that will resonate with me for days to come Well written
As story lines go it was ok but not compelling  Had a difficult time finishing the book  Read a lot of books this one just wasn't for me
This book is unlike any other book I've ever read It truly tugs on your heart strings and takes you on a ride of emotions until the very end
I would recommend this book to anyone affected by cancer It goes where everyone else is afraid to go It couldn't have been rewritten better
This book is amazing I'm the type of person who doesn't read a lot but when I started reading this book I couldn't stop TFIOS all the way :)
Very good caught my attention instantly John green has done it again with another breathe taking book that is loved by both teens and adults
Brilliant Brilliant Brilliant Brilliant Brilliant Brilliant Brilliant Brilliant Brilliant Brilliant Brilliant Brilliant Brilliant
There are so many honest thoughts in this book I truly enjoyed the way it is written - witty  current and sincerely It tugs at your heart 
John Green is a remarkable author  I was captivated from start to finish  I felt like every character was so real that they lived next door
I read this as the movie was coming out a good book - but not the most well written book I've ever read I enjoyed it though very emotional
Great book and story line  It makes you think about what others have to go through on a daily basis with chronic illnesses  No holding back
A fantastically sad funny and beautiful story about living a life worth noticing I laughed and cried sometimes at the same time Fantastic
Absolutely amazing  Refreshing Looking forward to more of John Green's work &amp; bless him for doing his research and acknowledging the family
Although this was a terribly sad and depressing story just as the characters felt about living each other the experience was worth the pain
You think you know the outcome but still can't put it down  It leaves you wanting to live the fullest out of everyday you have  Beautiful
Could not put the book (kindle) down  I would recommend this book highly and re-read It has great balance of sadness humor love and fear
An amazing illustration of terminal illness Though fictional this story speaks to the journey of hope pain and love Absolutely beautiful
I have nothing more to say than wow It's such a great book with so many plot twist I would recommend this book to any reader Young or old
It is a lovely novel Makes you see this known situation from a completely new point of viewFast and easy to read Easy to get addicted
I was hesitant to read this story thinking it would just be really depressing Although sad it was really a beautiful story Glad I read it
It wasn't that great  Your typical predictable cancer story  And the whole plot wasn't good at all  My Sister's Keeper was wayyyyy better
Great read but you'll need Kleenex when you read itespecially if you are a parent or know anyone who is going through a similar experience
I loved this bookI cried and laughed I loved the writing Everyone needs to read this book I wish I could say more words how amazing it is
Great book Such a moving and beautiful book Recommend it to anyone who wouldn't mind shedding a tear for a great story You won't regret it
I loved the carisma driving the two cancer victims together I suggest this book to ages 12-infinity Fantastic love story with a twist
Read it in two days  Very moving love story of teens with very serious illnesses  Will be interesting to see how the movie follows the book
John Green hits the big questions and genuine emotions with his engaging story Open the book and find yourself cheering for life and meaning
Once I started reading this book I literally could not put it down  It has been a while since I read a book that captivated me in such a way
This is one of the best books in human history I personally wish that there would be  a sequel because that would be just amazing and stuff
Fantastic writer and take of love pain and living  Powerful emotions where it is so easy to imagine the characters coming alive on the page
This book was absolutely amazing I could not put it down Highly recommend it  Can't wait to see the movie I hope it does the book justice
This is a sad but honest teenage love story challenging what's important in one's final days on Earth - whether that time is sooner or later
An amazing book about love and death It left me with a feeling of hope for mankind our society and the living as we journey towards the end
This story really just goes to show you how much cancer sucks Good story though God bless those who are fighting fought and won the fight
A fast read but beautiful in an angst sort of way Once again about youth living an independent life and little parental support or influence
This book was the best book ever I want to read more books by john green I hope every body else that reads this book loves it as much as did
Very well written love story and life lessons all in one A behind the scenes so to say of daily dealing with cancer Enjoyable for all ages
Ending predictable after about half of the book but well written sad funny and heartwarming I'd recommend reading before seeing the movie
This book was heart felt and magnificently descriptive I loved it more than any other book I've ever read in my life The story is brilliant
Good quick read Very sweet story  I think it tries to be a little too profound but I get that with this type of story Would recommend it
A good book moves very quickly I thought it would be more emotional for the reader but the humor makes the subject matter easier to absorb
This book really let's you see the existing realities in the world and to be grateful for what you have These kids can teach society so much
A great book makes you never want to put it down and that is what this book did for me I fell in live with this book because it is INSPIRING
Quick readThe last 100 pages make sure you have the tissues handy Takes a turn that you would not believeYoung love is amazing
I fell in love with this book like I fall asleep not at all and then all at once  Always and okay to me  It was an emotional roller coaster
Beware I had to cry a lot John green is an awesome writer and knows ho  to bring out  emotion in his readers I highly recommended this book
This book has a slow start but after you get to a certain point you will not want to put it down I would describe it as a quirky love story
I really enjoyed this book and I absolutely loved John Green's writing style I will definitely re-read this book and I highly recommend it
AmazingI laughed I bawled I absolutely adored this book It's a must read I can't wait to see the movieI hope it lives up to the book
I cried when I found out that he died  it killed me I read the book in like 3 or 4 days it's a great book but sad  :( great ending tho
I couldn't put it down throughout the whole thing and I was worried that the book would end mid sentence not answering all of our questions
I enjoyed the book and would recommend it to friends The story line was a little too predictable and that is why I gave it 4 stars and not 5
Enjoyed reading this tremendously I experienced the joys of life &amp; inescapable truths of death while relating to the sarcasm used throughout
Best book ever  Would highly recommend this book to middle and highSchool students as well as adults John Green is a fabulous author
I love tfios so much It has a great story behind it I would deffinily recommend it #lovedit john needs to make a fault in ours stars # 2
I laughed I cried  I will always be grateful for everyday I am blessed with this book is a reminder we only live once enjoy the roller coast
I cried but I loved it I finished it in less than 24 hours I broke night &amp; it was worth it I'm glad I got to read it before the movie came out
I loved this book more than any other I can't wait for the movie although it will not compare to the book Books are always better READ IT
I could not put this book down The characters were unbelievably real A truly inspiring story that had to be lived in some way by the author
Great read highly recommend it to anyone looking for a good story that could be true Also by the authorLooking for Alaska also a great read
It was a little slow at times but shows compassion and humor Probably geared to a teenage group I like that it shows you are not invincible
A lovely story heartwarming and full of wit The story of Hazel and Gus is moving and you'll put the book down feeling sad but also content
Excellent Couldn't put it down once I started  I will wait til the movie comes out on DVD to watch at home alone with a box of tissues
This book had me hooked from the beginning It quickly became one of my top five favorite books of all time I would recommend it to everyone
Green perfectly captured the protean emotional range juxtaposed and couched within the dialectical lines of innocence and it's fiery opposite
Touching book but also very funnyIt's much more realistic then other books where the princess gets the Prince it's how life actually is
Great book  Very sad subject matter  It really makes you appreciate every minute of your life and to be thankful of the people in your life
This is probably my favorite book of all time This is my second time reading it and I love it even more now I can't wait to see the movie
No book has ever gotten me emotional before- no book except for this one This book will always have a special place  in my heart I love this
The Fault in our Stars was a book that taught me of love and how it can't blinded by disabilities Love with the one you love is always Okay
Fast read poignant and gives pause to life I decided to read based on the 12000+ other 5 star reviews They did not disappoint Great book
I loved this book so much It was so much more than just a love story and I cried for about an hour I would recommend reading this right now
This is an awesome book that leaves you in tears but in the best possible way It is better to loved and lost then to never have loved at all
this book made me want to read it again right away it is one that will make you think about everything that is important about life read it
SPOILER DO NOT READ THIS IF YOU HAVEN'T READ THE BOOK YET It's really good but I hate that Gus dies in the end It should've been Hazel
I enjoyed this book  Interesting perspective on life and death  Thought that it was written very wellI'd recommend reading this book
I couldn't put it down A wonderful story of young fated love between two highly intellectual kids Read it Hazel's story is truly beautiful
Loved this storyeven though it was sad it was also upliftingit gave me hopemade me think about what I might do if I knew I was dying
This book is not just a book about love but rather a book about life This book will change your life I highly recommend this to anyone 13+
I laughed I criedI mostly criedBeautiful work from John Green The characters are masterfully developed and rang true to me Loved it
complex and extremely likeable characters lead to a truly enriched storyline thought-provoking smart and very emotional quick read as well
This book is absolutely amazing It really speaks to the reader It's definitely one of my favorite books I have read it three times already
Such an incredible story The characters are so vivid and real that it makes you feel like you're there with them Can't wait for the movie
Moving and beautiful The characters will stay with you long after you've finished reading I highly recommend reading The Fault In Our Stars
Loved the whole story I cannot wait for the movie I hope it will do the book justice Recommend to anyone looking for a sappy clean romance
This book what truly incredible John Green has a way with words that almost no one does if you haven't read this book you need too right now
This book was a great book that I would recommend to any readers who need a good book It is going up in my ratings as top 3 A very good book
I very much enjoyed reading this book The only thing I dislike however is its abrupt ending Besides that complete genius Complete genius
Great book really captures a love between two people I don't want to give it away but definitely grab a box of tissue Written so beautiful
Enjoyable read captivating and sweet Interesting honest and real inside look at life with terminal illness I would absolutely recommend
By far the best book Unlike other books this book makes you keep reading Since I finished this book I don't know what to do with my life lol
This book was so good I could not put it down Finished it in a day John Green is a wonderful author First book I bought on my kindle app
Worth every penny and more I suggest to anyone on the fence about reading it to dive on in Though I suggest you have a box of tissues handy
Excellent book Well written Tear jerker  Loved the ending I loved the characters and the relationship that was built Highly recommend it
This book made me madsad and happy at the same time This book makes you feel shitty for living but happy to read their story A must read
A beautiful poetic masterpiece of young-adult lit This novel will make you cry laugh and reconsider the entire genre of teen lit Loved it
I loved  it I literally cried towards the end It was amazing It is worth the money I love my book choices and this is one of my favorites
This is an amazing story with outstanding dialogue and beautifully drawn characters You will laugh and you will cry I didn't want it to end
This isn't normally my type of book; I usually prefer sci fri But if you're going to read a romantic book and want to cry then buy this one
this novel was terrific it makes you ride this crazy emotional roller coaster with the characters and in the end you feel surprisingly whole
What an outstanding book Easily my favorite book  I cannot obtain the words needed to clarify how great it was besidesThe feels
Leaves you wondering  whats left after all is lost in your life a romantic tale about two cancer patients who fall in love knowing the losses
If you have ever taken the time to think about death and dyeing and the universe etc on an intellectual level then you will enjoy this book
Be prepared to feel all of the emotions And tears Lots of tearsHazel and Augustus are wonderful John greens writing is terrific
This was a rather sad story about young people with cancer  I had to read it for a Book Club otherwise I don't think I would have chosen it
All I can say is be prepared to fall in love with this book And also don't read it in a public place where it wouldn't be acceptable to cry
Excellent book John Green masterfully describes a very delicate topic the text is interesting deep and can be a great collection of quotes
It was very well written  Lots of big words maybe too large for teens  Some interesting incites about life and death here and now and why
I loved the book and it is in great condition thank you very much It's great to know that the purchase came just the way I expected it to :)
I loved the characters and their quirkiness Every minute matters to each of us We are not our diseases but  rather how we relate to others
This book is good for teenagers It's told from a college freshman with cancer A bit juvenile for me; however I'm in the 40 something range
I prefer happier books after this one  Love the character and definitely something I can't relate fortunately I feel blessed to be healthy
I'm a middle school English teacher and I like to keep my finger on the pulse of my kids I read the books they read so we can meaningful dialogue  A few years back when they were reading the Twilight series I wanted to put a bullet in my head  I thought this novel would be more of the sameMuch to my surprise John Green penned a superbly written narrative that held my interest throughout the entire novel  His characters are three-dimensional and he nailed the voice of Hazel Grace; I work with kids and I know how they sound  I have ordered dozens of copies of this for my students and I took a group to see the movie after we finished post-reading discussions  I will remember this novel as the one that sparked so many of my non-readers  Great job Mr Green
Best book ever I watched the movie before I read the book so I already knew about what happens but the book is WAYYY better than the movie
i very rarely become so engaged with a book that i crytfios did just thatyou wont be the same after reading this book thankyou john green
This book is written with like able characters in sad situations It's definitely a wonderful read and a good life appreciation type of book
Nice story about teens going through a disease that one would hope could be eliminatedSome attitude by the teens who knew how to live
This is definitely a book I could read over and over again It brought tears to my eyes and also made me laugh The story touches your heart
I am overwhelmed with emotionsand I can't find words to describe the tremendous beauty of this book It is simply a magnificent achievement
The Fault In Our Stars is a love storyBut it's an incredible oneIf you don't read it and think it's stupidYou're mind isStars
Very good book and the book shows that life is short and love is strong very relaxing Once you start reading the book it sucks you right in
Beautifully written Funny sad true wonderful intense - I could not put it down - and then I couldn't stop crying for the last two hours
Oh my gosh this book is the best Please write more like this I have never read anything like it This book is one you can't read just once
You will cry It's a beautiful book but be prepared for tears and some excellent teenage craziness that seems more adult and worldly somehow
Very good Thoroughly enjoyed minus the sobbing Glad I read the book instead of watching the movie Hard to put down Like able characters
What a wonderfully yet emotional book The author should be very pleased with himself now I just hope they didn't ruin it with the movie
Wow wow and wow This book took my breath away Great writing touching story humor What more could you want An enthusiastic five stars
its a good book it has a lot of emotion some of the supporting characters are just blurs as they were not described very well but thats it
Excellent book  Kept me interested from the first few pages  Very heartwarming clean love story with moments of tears  Highly recommend
Received the book as a gift I didn't read the whole book I think it is definitely for a younger audience What I did read was well written
It was good but I wish I read the book before the movie since I kept seeing the actors instead of the people that the author was describing
This really didn't live up to my expectations I have not seen the movie so I'm not even basing it on that I was just kind of disappointed
Lots of twists turns and Surprises Didn't want to stop reading Worth reading if you looking for something light and easy  Very enjoyable
Very well written Tugs at the heart strings At times I couldn't read for not being able to see through my tears Have the tissues ready
Best book I have ever read I am a slow reader because I space it out I read this book in less than 24 hours because I couldn't put it down
This book had it all I have read many books but I finished it in 2 hours It intrigued me from page 1 I want to read more John Green books
This book was truly inspiring and quite touching It has been a long while since I have been so emotionally involved and attached to a novel
This was an incredible book I could not put it down once I started From start to finish it took me 4 hours to read and a box of tissues
One of the best books I've read in a VERY long time And the movie is absolute perfection Read the book see the movie You won't regret it
A very readable story  A teens take on dealing with cancer  Parts were laugh out loud funny and of course it was very touching and sad too
It was such a motivational book It was like a roller coaster ride; it had its ups and downs but turned out great in the end Love the book
Absolutely worth the $5 to read this Absolutely awesome book For this sensitive readers get your Kleenex ready because it's a tear jerker
Predictable book and a completely cheesy and unrealistic story line The characters were totally unbelievable A disappointing read for sure
Green writes about teens in a smart thoughtful sense His stories are real and the characters in them exhibit qualities that we all possess
Well-written and very sad (as you'd expect any story about cancer patients to be) A heart-wrenching love storyNo spoilers here
AMAZING and moving the characters really take you into their world I cried I definitely recommend reading this book you will not regret it

Awesome Just awesome I loved every bit of this book The characters the setting the plot Outstanding boo Highly recommended to everyone
Do NOT NOT NOT read this book  Just Just don't do it  Don'tAnd for your own sake do not even attempt to read it in public
This book changed my life I am so in love with it I can't even explain it  I encourage everyone to read it because it's just amazing 
Ok so this book is amazing I reccomend it to all of the people in this vast world actually this vast umiverse (Gallifrey) Enjoy it
This book was unexpected humorous deeply depressing and intentionally well written It was great I'll be picking up his other books soon
One of the best books I have ever read  Beautifully written  I highly recommend  It provides great perspective on love friendship death
A interesting book aswell  very entertaining We think too little about lifeand deathAnd this bookmakes it more clear and  less scary
I don't even know how to describe it Dark hilarity Sadness true love pain laughter cancer teenagers who are smarter than most adults
I love that I'm getting graded to dissect one of my favorite novels so that I might use it as a teaching tool one day Thank you John Green
Enjoy is hard to use for a book with the subject  Yet I could not put it down  Lately I feel like YA novels are better written than adult
This book was OK for young adults me being 25 found it very predictable and somewhat boring  But I could see how teenagers would enjoy it
This was a really nice story which had me feeling sad &amp; happy all at once very good read &amp; would recommend it to anyone who likes a good cry
If you are into sappy love stories then I think you will love this book to me the characters and the plot were just too sappy to resonate
It was a good read I have read his other books and they are also a good read Nothing mind blowing but not bad either Gave it three stars
I found The Fault in Our Stars to be enjoyable to read and could not set it down from the moment I started it The book teaches a great lesson of looking on the bright side even when things get tough Although Hazel has cancer and could relapse at any time she continues to chase her dream of meeting her favorite author in the hopes of getting answers to what happens to the characters The romance within the novel between Hazel and Augustus is interesting and at times it is easy for the reader to forget that the young couple actually have cancer This makes it even harder in the end This book both moves the reader and makes the reader laugh out loud Hazel is sharp and witty taking her life as it comes and living for the momentThis book is definitely a must read
I always hate giving a 5-star review but this one deserves it New York Times Bestselling Author John Green is my all-time FAVORITE author I've read all of his books watch his vlogs and support anything he does The Fault in Our Stars is an emotional funny and true teenage story (to say the least) It follows some of literatures best characters through their depressing and unfortunate lives That may not sound flattering but trust me it is This book IS a quick read but you'll find yourself wanting to come back for more Me not a usual novel crier shed some tears It finds a deep place in your heart connects and then brings back some personal memories Green has outdone himself I'm glad that he wrote this but there's one problem: how will he top himself
I didn't stop reading until I ran out of pages I sobbed unabashedly and only cleared the tears so I could keep reading Have tissues handy
A story that made me accept and realize the joys and pain of living Beautiful people that inspire are what make this book hard to put down
One of the few books that almost made me cry  I recommend this to anyone who welcomed a bleak viewpoint on the world   Bleak to blissful 
The last 3 minutes ( Gus's eulogy for Hazel) is amazing And the best part is John's style of writing its a little like modern Shakespeare
I'm so glad I decided to read this before seeing the movie What a wonderful love story It has ups and downs and warm n fuzzies Easy read
After all the hype this book got I expected it to be more interesting Its an easy read with no real depth Recommended for teenagers only
it was recommended to me ill be honest and say I though it was gonna be boring Completely amazing I was wrong Definitely glad I read it
I spent a lot of time looking up meanings of words &amp; contemplating the significance of my own existence That's all ask for &amp; more in a book
To John Green the author of this book Just two words Thank YouTo the rest of you you will find yourself deep in love with this book
By far one of the best books I've read  Love the wit and charm even in the saddest part of the story you catch yourself smiling and crying
Told realistically from the standpoint of young adults who often have a different slant on life  The twist in the plot added to the story
Just amazing This author is incredibly talented and creative You will laugh and you will cry It's a story about life and it's incredible
This is the most romantic heartbreaking awesome book ever Read it I can't wait to watch the movie This book was so sad and happy
A love story a story of strength and courage  We should embrace each day with the same vigor and resoluteness as Augustus and Hazel Grace
I cried with Hazel and Gus This book touched the depths of my heart Thank you I couldn't put it down I fell in love with the characters
The teenage girls in my life said it was a must read so I read it:) I enjoyed it and I loved the insights I gained Sad bookbut worth it
Funny smart encouraging wise and hard to set asideI  think I'll read it againand in printit will sit on my shelf to remind me
Great read Definitely puts you in the characters' footsteps giving you a better understanding and empathy for their disease and situations
I still criedbut the best thing about this book was how much I laughed Difficult topic with love &amp; loss but so much humor I loved it
I wish I could write an eloquent review worthy of this booksuch a sweet love storysad but so real I highly recommend checking it out
such an awesome descriptive realistic book overall a 10 definitely for someone who loves the emotional type loved every second of it
This book was hard to put down It was sad and funny and painfully real and so well written I look forward to reading more from John Green
The book finished without finishingwanted it to truly end  I felt cheated  Bummer that's all I can saydisappointed in the ending
I purchased for my 15 year old daughter she wanted to read the book before the movie came out  She finished the book in 3 days  LOVED it
This book was amazing I cried for hours and hours And I almost felt like I was in love with Augustus waters I recommend this to everybody
Even though this book is apparently in the young adult category and I am considerably older than that I really enjoyed this book
Good story  Sometimes sad sometimes funny  I wasn't too thrilled with the ending  I will have to rent the DVD now to see the difference
Probably one of the best books I've ever read Sad but thought-provoking Kudos to you John Green Definitely going to read his other books
I watched the movie first so I could see the movie while reading it was amazing but what does happen to Anna's mom I kinda want to know

The author does a spectacular job of making the characters come alive This book is a heartfelt tragedy that will pull you in from page one
no words will be are appropriate to describe this book you can't describe it or even really talk about it you have to read it and feel it
Read it  It is almost excruciating to those of us who survive cancer patients and yet it is comforting in the same breath  A must read
I cried and be prepared to be in a bad mood for a week when this book ends :) (I'm not Paul I'm his daughter my dad would never read this)
This book will make you cry But it is absolutely fantastic Well written and discusses things that many people just want to stay away from
The best book I have ever read both exciting and thoughtful  I'm a guy and I thought this book would suck but it's the best book I have ever
This book takes a difficult subject that is often avoided and brings light to what little we know about it it humanized the face of cancer
This book is absolutely amazing It goes up and down a lot and I love how the book seems so modern Definitely read it you won't regret it
Justdo yourself a favor a read the book Its eye opening beautiful and way beyond worth your time Actually beyond beautiful but whatever
We'll written and engaging and honest without being maudlin  It's been a long time since a book made me tear up without using cheap tricks
What a unique story It was so well written and the characters were very human I can't recommend this book enough Can't wait for the movie
This book has changed how I see the world  Everything is a side effect if dying but I will admire nature for as long as I am permitted to
I loved this book It was absolutely incredible If you're thinking about reading it you should I'm gonna recommend this book to everyone
Strength of this work is the development of characters I felt a strong connection to them (despite my being an adult and they being teens)
I am not an emotional person but I truly enjoyed thus book It was very honest and heartfelt A great read that I would suggest to everyone
I loved the characters and the dialogue between them Though they were teenagers they had some great intellectual discussions and insights
I can not describe what i was feeling when I was done with this book I loved it And I am probably going to read this book again some day
The Fault in Our Stars is a emotional book made for for high school students In this book it made you feel how the other person was feeling
Although a little bit of a downer great topic and great book  Author does a great job creating characters  Highly recommend for any age
Great and very quick read A very sweet thoughtful reflection on love and loss and adolescence and real life and meaning for (not of) life
A must readthe writer puts down the real meaning of love so beautifullyu feel sad and proud for both Hazel and Gus at the same time

Another good read by John Green; he does not disappoint A positive story involving a serious illness from the viewpoint of a young woman
Extremely emotional and so very touchingwell rendered It brings tears to your eyes you feel for the Charecters Gripping heart wrenching

I don't read this stuff but really enjoyed this  Very well written  Could not stop reading  Highly recommended reading by a curmudgeon
After seeing the movie I had to read the book  Tender romance that was doomed from the start  Enjoyed the read but heartbreaking theme
This book was an amazing book and I hope to have time to read it again because it had heart and it was funny at the same time to make great
The book was good but the movie was really different I would read the book first  if were youbut other than that it's very good
Besides being a great story- there are so many poignant quotes  I enjoyed every second of this book - would almost say this is a must read
Wonderful read It kept me intrigued and never wanted to set the book down Very real-life scenario which became a tear jerker at the end
Simply brilliant Heartwarming and authentic One of the best contemporary novels without question Do yourself a favor and read this book
This book is EVERYTHING you expect and more Keep the tissues handy Hazel and Gus will touch your heart in more ways than you can imagine
Nicely written allowing people who have health issues to know what love is and how to live laugh &amp; hope together instead of being alone 
I laughed I cried I'm sure I'll be enjoying this love story over and over  Hazel and Gus have such a beautiful little infinity together

Very different book with such an unusual view of facing death  Rather depressing yet not enough for me to put it down or stop reading it
Characters tnst you can enjoy Plot is interesting enough to make you want to read on Not my normal fantasy novel but still a good read
Heavy topic beautifully written to see a wretched disease from a POV of the young sufferer Engaging and witty despite it's seriousness
This book covers death love and envy It really gives a profound view from the patient perspective Well written Recommended for all
Provided a lot of depth  - relationships friendships loss deathwhile taking me back to what it was like to be a teenager in love

This book had a lot of feeling into this This is one of the best books I ever read it is very addictingThe movie was very good too

I had to make myself stop reading and go on with life Hazel and Augustus are remarkable characters whom I will remember for a long time
We'll written and apple sly to young people written from a young persons point of view Difficult from an older persons outlook on life

Great book - and while it is supposedly geared to young teens or adults the vocabulary is very sophisticated It is a great summer read

When I started reading  a could not put it away I like it very much this book It's an amazing story about two people that fall in love
It is Fresh and heartfelt but not too sentimental  You can easily get caught up in what is going on and the quirkiness of the characters
This book was a really great read It was one I didn't want to put down Green does a good job of pulling the reader into the story line
Don't have the words to say wow I cry with other books but this one has thought me life is too short and to learn and thank God every day

The characters were realistic and likable  It depicts young love in the midst of sorrow which although sad is surprisingly uplifting

Took a while to warm up but then it just rushed toward its emotionally satisfying end  I highly recommend this book to any avid reader
I thought this book was sad sweet and really enjoyed the characters  I like how the characters make you understand and feel their pain
Almost everyone that i talked to said this was an amazing book that I would love I didn't love the book the vocabulary in this book in my opinion was very hard for me to understand so I was confused on what they were talking about most of the time I'm 14 and it was very hard for me to read this book there was so much advanced vocabulary that it seemed to overpower the story of the book I like the story of it I just wish it was written a different way so people could read it without skipping words or taking forever to sound out a word they didn't even know This is just my opinion and for some people it was a great book I don't want to stop anyone from reading this book because of my opinion I just wanted to share it like Hazel Grace did
I knew and loved a young girl who knew she was dying so I am a very tough critic to get by on this subject I think Hazel is an impressive portrayal of a girl who knows she has a limited time to live  And she finds another person to journey with her in Augustus  For adults lurking on the edges of a child facing death the puzzle of comfort is all but overwhelming  But I agree with Hazel she doesn't fear death as much as she fears obliteration and never having mattered  As time goes by many of us adults forget the passion that burned in us to be a star in the sky  This fate appears to have befallen the author they pursueWhatever the answer when our stars have given us little time in which to shine the fault must lie in them
I must say that this is the second book that I have read by this author the first one being Looking For Alaska and once again  am left utterly speechless I was pulled in multiple different directions with my emotions feeling as if I was riding along the shoulders of each character John Green beautifully illustrates the jourmey that these characters take together on their cancer battles and remissons After completing this book Im left wanting more craving relationships like the ones constructed within the book and left reevaluating my life in the best ways possible This book has tugged at my heartstrings leaving me with great expectations for John Greens books to come I will definitely reread this book time and time again a great read
I picked up The Fault in our Stars by John Green because of several recommendations by various friends This was the first of John Green's books I've ever read and it is now one of my favorite books of all time Green not only told a story about the love between Hazel and Augustus but also confronted bigger issues than I expected him to This novel was so deep elaborate and vibrant which I never expected it to be I cried and laughed along with the characters Though one of the big things in the novel is cancer the story of Hazel and Augustus overpower it The story simply becomes the love story between two young people who try to live their lives to the fullest while they still can I love this book and cannot say enough praise about it
I have read this book 100s of timesand every time I cry laugh and feel everything that Hazel and Agustus Waters are feeling
A heartfelt and very romantic book that teaches you a lot about friendship and love I enjoyed reading this book and the show was great
Absolutely worth reading Seriously touching and thinkable Loved reading the story from a view that I have never read form before
This book was really good Although someone had spoiled the end it wasn't exactly what I had though and was deeper than I had expected
Favorite book everI rated this book five stars because I think I am going to go crazy if I don't read it twice Read this book
Wonderful book  Very touching and amusing  You feel like you are right there feeling what the characters are feeling  High recommend
Everyone read it Great book Wish I read it earlier Such an inspirational story Great book for most ages Excited to watch the movie

Love the characters Couldn't put it down Easy to read Never saw the twists coming  Very moving Wonderful handling of a delicate topic

What a great sad deep story and a different viewpoint on what it's like to live with cancer Very well written wonderful characters
Deep thoughts about human existence and how our lives are so fragile A sad story but true sadness would have been to never have loved
I loved it  It had a surprise ending for me  Even though the subject is  a sad one the way it is written sweetens the pill
very good book look forward to reading more from this author eventually I must watch the movie now to see how it compares to the book
Great book I did have some tears though It makes you think about how we get frustrated in little thongs without realizing the big pic
The story is great The author ties everything together  I couldn't stop reading  The ending leaves the reader wondering what happens
The highest rated YA book of all time With now the movie what more can I sayGet the tissue box I can't keep thinking about it
Read it Just do it Please We all need to be able to live filled with optimism that is so wonderfully present in our everyday lives
Loved this book from start to finish  Such a sad topic but wonderfully written  I look forward to reading more of John Green 's work

Sweet and pure A definite tear jerker Easy to read and the authors use of words sucks you into the lives of these two wonderful teens
this is the best book I have ever read hands down it makes you laugh cry smile and see life in a different perspective okay okay

Very cleverly written  I really enjoyed reading this book  Makes me think about life a little dofferently  Thanks for the great read
Sweet story It all tied together when I wondered why they were talking about other books And there is an unexpected twist in the plot
A beautifully written story mixing sadness and humor in exact proportions  Meaningful for all readers - young adult to senior citizen
Finally finished the book and words can't explain all the emotions I felt You must read thisyour life will feel incomplete without it
What a wonderful viewpoint on life I experienced every emotion that one can feel I think as I read this book I couldn't put it down

It was moving beautiful and I loved itI wish more people loved as much in a lifetime as Gus and Hazel loved in their time
I read the book in 4 days I was going to see the movie but after reading the book I decided not to because it would be very depressing

It completely deserves five stars It made me cry at times and it makes me open my eye to the world and see people out there suffering
This book was clever insightful and emotional Note that there is some bad language otherwise I would have given it a five star rating
If you can feel you will feel this book  This ride with Hazel and Augustus is a realistic look at cancer and a hopeful glance at love
I have never had a book bring me to tears and this one did me in A fantastic heartfelt and beautiful book I encourage all to read it

My daughter and I book read this book and enjoyed the wit and sense of humor It shows a very different perspective of terminal illness
I can not really form words I am just heartbroken Utterly despicably pathetically inevitably broken hearted after this great read
I think if was really good but u thought it would b life changing by the way ppl spoke about it I liked it but iv read better books
This book felt as though the author was intentionally creating sad content to invoke feeling out of the reader I felt it was overrated
Once i started reading I simply could not stop thinking about the characters and wanting more Loved this book Cant wait for the movie
Characters are whitty and amazing Definitely a good casual read Be prepared to be shocked in parts I would recommend this to everyone
This actually made me cry Good job Well written and engaging Funny and touching The characters were real and made you care for them
This book really touched my heart and it's not particularly deep but it makes you think You don't expect it to end in the way it does
I can't even explain this book it is amazing and I highly recommend you read it It is a emotional rollercoaster but man it's worth it
still sobbing my eyes outIf you read one book your whole life read this book because it will change it It will change your life
Very insightful I wish I had thought as deeply as theses characters do at 16 or 18 The book offers smiles laughs honesty and tears
Intelligent believable and engrossing Very worthwhile read My book club thoroughly enjoyed reading it and we had a lively discussion
Some of it was not imaginable but for the most part it is a good love story; looking forward to seeing how they convert it into a movie
So painful wise and absorbing  Couldn't stop thinking about the characters their courage life death what's it all about anyway
This book takes time to take all of the innuendos in and to intellectualism the emotional impact It provides a voice to understanding
John Green captured the meaning of young love Intelligent sexy funny and heart breakingit was an emotional ride for me Thank you
I couldn't put this book down I felt it was slightly predictable but well-written and enjoyable Reminds  me in a way of Jodi Picoult
Sad heroic funny and heartwarming This has got to be our generations Romeo and Juliet A classic in the making Beautifully written
I loved this book I laughed I got angry I cried Never in my life have I loved characters so much I hope I can last until the movie

I don't want to give away or spoil the enjoyment of this book by praising the book too much-- I just say that I was glad that I read it
This is one of the most beautifully written books I have ever read Moving honest and unforgettable I want to read it all over again
I love it such an intense book Beautifully written and a great story line Cliff hangers at the end of the chapter was great loved it
I really liked this novel The subject matter is sad but the story is told with enough spunk and humor to even it out Great characters
This was utterly and basically indescribably perfect I cried smiled laughed and cried some more Sheer and utter perfection Period
Well written and characters were freshly drawn Not sentimental but heartachingly sad  Deeply engrossing and I finished it in two days

John Green is an amazing writer It's like he know just what bones to hit in teenagers to keep them interested #augustusandhazelforever
Profound honest so moving I couldn't put this book down I feel like I knew Augustus and Hazel and fell in love right alongside them
Got my niece a Kindle fire for Christmas and she requested this book She spent the next few days reading it and then said it was great
Amazing book that is impossible to put down and practically effortless  to read because of its sheer perfectionGreat read overall
I literally just finished this book I'm literally heartbroken Everyone should read this book (Ps there's a lot of large vocab words)
The story of Hazel her love and understanding of the world was beautifully written I would recommend this book to anyone and everyone
I chose to read this book based on the upcoming movie but I got so much out of this bookit taught me a lot of good meaningful messages
I'll just start with the fact that I'm NOT a YA but I LOVED this book  It was funny romantic engaging and sad  Beautifully written
This book was one of the most beautiful most amazing things I have ever read I will never forget this book and how much it means to me
It was absolutely amazing I couldn't put it down My favorite book hands down I definitely recommend this book Thank you John Green
I enjoyed the book but be prepared it's a tearjerker  Overall it's well written but there are a few parts that are difficult to read
I know this book has gotten a lot of hype but it is well deserved  Beautifully written and touching  The characters felt real too me
I enjoyed this insight into the world of teens with cancer Some things are the same between teens in love whether you are sick or not
I LOVED this book As a two-time survivor of leukemia and someone who has many friends with varying illnesses (some of whom have the same diagnosis/medical issues as the two main characters) it was the only book I've read that made me feel as though I was reliving that part of my life It's combination of humor disability community sorrow and the inclusion of romance dreaming etc was flawless The ONLY thing I didn't appreciate was that every time the word leukemia was mentioned it was associated with death (there's an 85% survival rate people) Other than that Green did an impressive job of capturing 1) the sick 2) female 3) teenager I know I will re-read this book numerous times and feel that everyone should give it a shot
Wow there are so many things I'm feeling after I finished this book It was a bittersweet read but honestly it was mostly sweet Yes this book is about kids dying from one of the ugliest diseases out there but it is also about life About taking the pleasure and the happiness in the everyday things in the joy of getting to know someone and falling in love with someone It's not a sappy story it is real and it is raw and it was wonderful I was hesitant to read it for a long time because I thought it would be a non stop cry fest but it wasn't Yes it left me feeling sad but also joyful in knowing that even if it was only brief these two kids got to know and feel one of the greatest emotions a human can feel the feeling of being in love
I am a devourer of books Most books I read are decent some are good but This Book is truly spectacular I was worried it would be a bit dull and from the start I knew it wouldn't have a sappily romantic ending This book itself is much like the book WITHIN the book An Imperial Affliction I want to know what happens to Hazel and Isaac and all of the other 3 dimensional characters within the book I can easily put myself in the room with Augustus Hazel and Isaac on the Day of the Broken Trophies It is dazzlingly poignant and has made me think infinitely about the real infinity we all get with those who I love--no matter how short a time that might be It is perhaps one of the best books I have ever read and I highly recommend it
Sweet tearjerker
I felt like throughout this book a point was attempting to be proven but it didn't quite get there I absolutely loved the sampler I read on my Kindle but everything after that was simply alright I thought the love story was sweet but I felt more pity for each character than anything else Maybe there was a greater meaning that I failed to see but regardless it wasn't what I expected after the sampler Also the ending What is up with that Gus writes his letter and we don't even really hear what Hazel thinks of it We get two lines of her thoughts but that's it Are we to assume we know her well enough to guess what she would have felt after reading it Either way I didn't feel like the story really got the ending it deserved
Such a great story You can't go wrong with John Green; he is such a great writer I read this at the beach and could not put it down
It's understandable why author John Green strikes a chord with young readers It's a good book with a topic that's not often addressed
This boom was amazing it could not have been more realistic John green did a great job on this book and I could not have loved it more
It was so good i couldn't put it down  Finshed in 24 hours:) Easy read that will make you laugh hope and crysometimes all at once
Wonderful story Characters that are relatable engaging and drew me completely in I think I will check out other titles by John Green
Great book Pulls at the heartstrings Strikes the right balance between sacred and profane joyous and melancholy Highly recommended
This is a real tear maker but it's a very good book no matter whatThe books were it seems almost real but it's to far away üòÑüòÅüìö
So glad I read this before watching the movie It was incredibly more deep beautiful and tragic Thanks John Green needed this read
I really like this book and  movie is even sadder this book is  good for people to  really understand what cancer is and the pain of it
I didn't cry the big sobs friends told me I would  The words were beautifully strung together A wonderful reminder to live your life
Absolutely unbelievable I would read this book over and over again  The story just makes so much sense and just gets you so belated
Gives me a better understanding of some if the things my daughter is going through on a daily basis My daughter loves the book herself
I chose this rating because it was an amazing book It captures your heart and tells an amazing love story I want to reread this book
John Green is an excellent writer who uses lots of detail  I love this book because this book describes the life while you have cancer
I liked this book but didn't love it It seems like everyone else that bought it loved it but me In my opinion good but not fantastic
Such a wonderful book Tried not to cry so many times towards the end The Big Csuch a killer Love you Gus &amp; Hazel Graceand Isaac
guys what the hell am I going to do nowthis book was amazing and now life is pointless I'm going to eat my feelings away brb

Best book everI loved this book it was so interesting I didn't want to stop reading I was DO sad when I was done read ing it
i laughed I cried I enjoyed the journey  Who doesn't love this book  I have never found anyone  If you haven't read it you should
It was ok Just not a very engrossing story The characters were interesting enough just not interesting enough to keep me interested
This is probably the best YA book that is so much more than a YA book Great brutal honest narrative that is poetic and heartbreaking
Bought the best emotions out of me  Great read Really made my heart melt as soon as it got really good   Couldn't put the book down
Sweet and funny I had no idea what this book was about when I bought it nor that it was a YA novel It was enjoyable and a quick read
What a wonderful story of love and adolescents Loved it Made me yearn laugh smile and cry All the correct makings of a great book
Unparalleled story that makes you contemplate the human experience and fate of the universe Great read for any age Highly recommended
Still loved it still cried on my third reread Beautiful writing from John Green yet again Thank you for writing this powerful novel
It is definitely a youth novel but it was a learning experience of what it would be like to have someone so young be taken with cancer
This book was hard to set down very intriguing and emotional I recommend everyone read this book it was well worth the tears I shed
Absolutely loved this book Very easy to get acquainted with the characters and their stories Made me feel so many different emotions
So real heart felt Couldn't stop reading great characters you wanted them to be together And hope that there was ending to Van book
Very good book and an easy read  Didn't like the ending Could at least have given a hint of Hazels last days even if not happy ones
Please read this book it can change your life  A great story of courage heart determination romance and you will never forget it
Good read Great way to spend time with myself and do a little bit of crying too I don't know if I would want to see the movie though
BEST BOOK EVER Perfectly written to a crisp and I feel that every thing in the book connects with everything that is happening today
A beautiful heart wrenching story that must be read because pain demands to be felt Read this one with a tissue or twenty
My 12year old daughter suggested this story and I m glad she did It shows the resilience of youth and focuses on their great strength
Just say it was nice for a different point of view and thoughts revolving around cancer It makes you look at everything differently
It held my attention which is rare since I don't particularly like reading It never let me down and I definitely could't put it down
This book was a wonderful sad story I laughed and cried I will definitely recommend it to anyone who wants to read a wonderful book
I LOVE THIS BOOK SO MUCHIT IS AMAZINGI loved all of the detailAnd how it feels so real
At times this book was a bit hard to get into but all in all it was fabulous it gives you a small glimpse at what true love really is
Enjoyed it immensely  Easy read  Easily become attached to the characters Would recommend and thinking of reading more of his works
A compact seemingly young adult fiction with universal appeal Anyone contemplating their mortality would gain insight from this story
This book was exactly what I expected it to be I laughed and cried - often at the same time I am looking forward to seeing the movie
An amazing love story that is not a love story in the typical sense The characters are real and I characters can imagine meeting them
The book is well written and the point of view distances the reader from the inevitability of the hero and heroine's death Good story
It wasn't what I expected and I learned so much  Great read  Couldn't put it downIt was cleverly quirky and yet so meaningful
Terrible ending :( great story though Wish there was more closure-kinda leaves the reader dangling Would recommend for an easy read
Very beautifully written I laughed out loud and definitely cried An amazing book I had to watch the movie and it did not disappoint
I loved the book I couldn't put it down My favorite book this year It was a heartwarming book I will definitely be reading it again
I am just amazed at the author's insight and talent at sharing it So happy my granddaughter shared her favorite author's book with me
I enjoyed reading this thought provoking novel Well written lovingly by John Green about young love and family friendship and cancer
Very touching of course I'm glad to have met all the characters in the book A good mix of humor and tragedy fun and pain
This book is simply amazing Definitely a must read for anyone who enjoys a sweet and funny romance that's sure to bring you to tears
I cried through out this whole love story I hope I meet my agustus waters and it would be a privilege to have my heart broken by him
If you have not read this book You are in no way prepared for this wonderful emotional roller coaster I frankly would read it again
Not sure what all the fuss is about Predictable plot Unrealistic / stilted dialog  It's ok but I'm not sure why it merited a movie
Just wanted to see what the buzz was about Nice read Not too complicated Reminds you to appreciate life and hug your kids every day
Read it in less than 24 hours And it was half off Great book I cried like a little baby through the last 1/3 of it Very touching 
This was a great book full of every emotion This book really makes you feel and kind of helps you put your life into perspective
This book will rip your heart out and shatter it to a million pieces but it's one of the love stories that will forever stick with me
Very interesting and unique book  Didn't want to put it down  Read it in two nights  Not predictable - kind of nice I recommend it
I couldn't put this book down Very thought provoking I would recommend this book to all readers Looking forward to seeing the movie
Yes it's one of those pluck at your heartstrings stories but written in an engaging and charming style  Well worth a read
It was a heart warming story that even my 12 year old granddaughter loved  Would recommend it to anyone looking for a nice love story
I fell in love with this book the second i picked it up i am not a big reader but i found this book and my life has changed forever
The fault in our stars was an amazing book it was very well written so happy that I purchases it It was well worth my time on reading
My 14 year old granddaughter loved the book and talked me into reading it I enjoyed it but could see why a teenage girl would LOVE it
I choose this rating because it is a very good bookI would consider this book to my momdadAshleyand my best friend Abbi
Creative and warm story Characterization was inviting Writing wasn't very deep but it was deep enough to balance the subject matter
Such a wonderful book and an even better movie I strongly suggest reading the book and seeing the movie It had me crying like a baby
After listening to the hype for the movie' I wanted to read it Some said it wasn't a book about cancer I'll have to think about that

i loved this book it was set up in such a way it could be relatable to someone in that situation it made me laugh and it made me cry
Life-changing tale of love and lossa must read Clear your calendar because once you start reading you will not stop until the end
This is the kind of book like the movie Titanic an amazing plot with a sad ending  I promise you this book will make you speechless
I enjoyed this on a flight Overall the concept for the book was interesting but there were a few implausible details that bothered me
Beautifully written John thank you for this lovely and heartwarming tale I loved every chapter every minute every page Thank you
This pulled me in kept me reading in spite of a dangerous possibly depressing story I cannot wait to buy another book by John Green
I liked these characters though felt they were totally unrealistic  I would recommend this book though as a good read  Funny and sad
In equal parts devastating and humorous worth the read for the glimpse it provides into the reality of living with a terminal illness
Doesn't seem like this is an accurate portrait of teenagers today I considered putting it down and calling it quits Very predictable
Makes one appreciate every day More than a love story it is a story of courage that one can only hope they would handle the same way
Often a book about characters that are sick makes me feel melancholy and sad  This book made me feel inspired and positive about life
I make it a point never to read sad novels but this one is as hilarious as it is heartbreaking An enjoyable and thought-provoking read
The writing is sharp and makes the reader feel invested in the characters  I thoroughly enjoyed and would recommend to adult readers
Interesting story but totally unrealistic as far as the vocabulary that teenagers (even sick teenagers) would use  A bit too erudite
I believe everyone should read this book The ending alone has so much emotion in it this is by far one of the best books I've read
Didn't know what I was getting into when I started  Needs to be a required reading for early teens in all schools (home schools too)
Finally finished A brilliantly written comical despondentamorous story If you haven't read it please do yourself a favor ‚ù§Ô∏è
After reading this book all I can say is that it was- Beautifully written and Unbelievably good It does get very emotional though
This book is so touching it made me cry It's a piece that has love and fighting I would give this book a million stars if I could
I rarely cry but this book brought tears a few times Such a sad touching story of two young people and their families A good read
I did enjoy this book but it took forever for me to finally go aww in this romance novel Sorry John Green but if I stay has you beat
So thoughtfully done This was a great story that gave so much insight on something that doesn't get brought up often Beautiful book
This book is a marvelous work It combines a love story with real life problems and tragedy Make sure you read with a box of tissues
this really showed me how valuable life and love really is to a person  it is so easy to fall in love but so hard to fall out if love
This book was heartbreakingly beautiful and I loved every moment of their love May every book leave a scarsuch as this one
This is one of the best novels I have read in a long time If you're thinking of reading The Fault in Our Stars make that a definite
I loved this book so much I want John Green to make a another book like this really badly I would recommend this to lots of people:)
Loved it Couldn't put it downA must read for all agesEnjoyed several of John Greens books including Looking for Alaska
I haven't seen the movieI hope it does this wonderful novel justiceloved it very sweet and poignantTwo thumbs up
Depressing and didn't really offer anything new  The story itself made me feel bad but did really invoke any deep feelings on my end
Enjoyed the entire read cried for Gus even though you kind of saw it coming Will go see the movie to see if it does the book justice
could not put the book down finished it in just two days such a great romantic love story with some sadness but still gives you hope
This book is very romantic although near the end it is sad my favorite quote is that's the thing about pain it's demanded to be felt
Whatever I say cannot do this book justice It was wonderful It made me laugh and cry but mostly just feel so lucky to have found it
Possibly one of the best books I have ever read Couldn't put it down Great look into the world of cancer and how people deal with it
I read it on my plane rides and cried  The author seems to know what cancer patients are going through  I can't say enough about it
Excellent I could say I had goosebumps the entire time I was reading it Each sentence is so beautifully phrased Just marvellous
Sad and sweet at the same time  Written with such feeling and emotion that you want to laugh and cry right along with those two kids
This story is wonderful amazingfunny and heartbreaking and I truly loved it It will take you in and make you believe in love again
Cancer is truly a horrible disease  Effects so many and this novel portrays well the impact on all involved  Glad made into a movie
Shown from a refreshing and new prospective I lived it It hit home for me and I will hold it close to my heart for a very long time
No really I love John Green and this book just gives that love even more legs to stand on Thank you Mr Green for a true love story
Wonderful book John Green brings these characters to life and you experience the highs and lows so emotional I would read it again
It was recommend by friends and it didn't disappoint  It's not the usual genre I read but that didn't matter its still a 5 star book
The Fault in Our Stars is just an outstanding book that takes your through so many different emotions it makes you happy sad angry
What a captivating read Once you start you can't put it down A beautiful disaster would be one way to describe this great read
I loved this book such a touching and emotional story Spent half the time reading and crying This was an absolutely Beautiful book
This is a beautiful love story It held my interest till the end It shows that young people can have true love and care about others
Crying Laughing Heart wrentchingly truthful I don't know how to encompass my experience with this book but John Green did Read it
A heartbreakingreal and compelling read Have the tissues at hand before you start readingyou won't want to put this book down
Being a cancer patient myself I found this book amazingly accurate to how cancer affects the patient and all those around the patient
this was an amazing book I can't even find the words to describe how great it was I recommend you read it and find out for yourself
Was one of the best books I've read in a long time The struggles young cancer patients have dealing with the diease and being a teen
In TFIOS John Green manages to capture a lot about teens very simply and really understands what we go through He is simply a genius
Excellent from beginning to end Definitely a quick read though Would reccommend this book to anyone who loves a little tear jerker
A love story about obstacles  challenges and faith  It will make you laugh and cryEmpowering young love that can't be shaken
I didn't cry like everyone else but if you're around someone that is suffering from a heartbreaking disease you will able to relate
ArghGreat book but what happened to Hazel Is there a second book I know it's fiction but it should have not ended with no closer
Excellent book I thoroughly enjoyed the book and didn't want it to end Can't wait to see the movie I hope follows the book closely
Well written and a fast read You will cry but the characters are so real and  so well done you feel like you are a part of the story
It was ok  Maybe I just had very high expectations but it is a young adult book makes sense  I thought it wasn't very believable
First time reading John Green's books A  great read it makes you rethink the little stuff in life &amp; be grateful for life it's self
I love this book I would recommend it to any person who wants to waste 3 or 4 tissue boxes on it Amazing book you need to read it
I really enjoyed reading this Make sure you have your Kleenex box nearby Such a great story I would definitely recommend this book
Loved it Gripping touching and surprising  Kept me wanting more yet I finished it in record time  The end was not what I expected
Young love at its finest Quirky and real Loved it Looking forward to the movieI think Sometimes movies disappoint Good read
My favorite book of all time  And the movie is great too  I encourage anyone/everyone to read it  Enjoy and get your tissues ready
I was not going to read this book but was told it was excellentI agree Now I can go see the movie which I hear is also excellent
I loved most of this book except some of the language I was disappointed when it ended thought it would've went on a little longer
Appreciated the glimpse into the lives of families coping with cancer A sweet love story of finding hope even in bleak circumstances
this book is extremely well written brought tears to my eyes because I felt like I was in it like it was happening before my eyes
I've read this book at least 3 times and each time I've balled my eyes out Definitely worth reading I cannot wait to see the movie
Hazel and Augustus meet at a cancer survivors support group and help each other keep living in a philosophical no man's land of death
An easy book to read but it packs plenty of emotion Even though the characters and story is fiction some of it is reality sadly
This book is an amazing piece of literary work It's a definite must read So thankful I read this instead of going to watch the movie
My students recommended this book  It is as good as they said it was  It's even more amazing knowing this was based on a true story
Great book A quick and easy read that keeps you involved with the characters  Although have your tissues ready maybe a box of them
Prepare for tears This book is a heart wrencher but it is extremely well written You fall in love with the characters and the story
I loved the book as has everyone I've recommended it to  It draws you right in and twists back on itself to a very unexpected ending
Such a great book If I could give it more then 5 stars I would I normally don't like tbesrt kinds of book but this one is fantastic
Seriously who does john green think he is writing this incredible ass book I need a sequel like yesterday I need him to write more
Very moving Grabs you and will not let go It tells the story and the emotions while allowing your own Will not be easily forgotten
Wow I enjoyed this story I didn't enjoy cryingthough Can't wait to see the movieI felt like I was there with Hazel and Gus
I normally have a hard time reading because I am easily distracted by my kids but I couldn't put this book down Beautifully written
Daughter (15) said to give it 10 out of 5 stars because it is that good  I will be reading it next and try to give an adult review
This was a great book I would recommend that everybody should read this I hope the movie is able to capture the feeling of the book
I loved this book it was so romantic and heartfelt The book was hard to put down I recommend it to anyone who loves a good romance
This book is absolutely amazing If you haven't read it yet you really should  The characters are great and the book is really funny
Well written thoughtful intelligent Wouldn't want to read too many on the same topic as it's faily depressing but very well done
John Green is the most amazing man that knows how to use a fictional character to brake someone's heart and then use humor to mend it
I could read this book over and over again because it's a awesome book I hope other people will or have had enjoyed it like I did :)
Amazing Amazing Amazing It was a simply beautiful yet heartbreaking story Loved watching these characters grow and become in love
Loved it John Green is amazing One of the best books I have ever read in my entire life Can't say anything else or I will spoil it
Such a moving story or young love and triumph against the odds of cancer I'm so glad to have read this book prior to seeing the movie
Ideas that make you think about your values and purpose no matter what your age A lovely book and gratifying read Not just for kids
this is a wonderful book about two teens going through what most adults couldn't endure  it is witty poignant and thought provoking
I really enjoyed this book and look forward to seeing the movie when it comes out  Sad bittersweet and joyful all at the same time
The way this book portrays the love and strength that two kids dying with cancer have is just beautiful I absolutely loved this book
Now I'll have to see the movie Prepare to feel some sadness but you will also feel joy at life that is real and loving and too short
Well written and liked the perspective from a teenager with illness  Very sad though and don't think I will be able to watch the movie
great quick read  reply impractical there is hope for the next-generation of teen age storiesDefinitely made me think Anand cry
Beautiful story about love and finding peace and beauty in self awareness and life You define yourself not what the world makes you
Very enjoyable book to read Only reason why I didn't give 5 stars bc more for younger readers in my opinion but overall a great book
Love Augustus and hazel Their story is full of heartbreak And encouragement I didn't care for the level of teen angst and wordiness
I LOVE THIS BOOK SO MUCH AHHH AHHH this book is my reason for living thank you so much for helping my life you are my Peter van Hutton
The character s were very likable I read this book because my teenage daughter wanted me to but it is a powerful story for all ages
This is a very beautifully written book but completely heartbreaking This book definitely affects you emotionally I cried A lot
John Green probably one of the best communicators of our time everyone should read The Fault in Our Stars Goddamn the man can write
Grabs from first paragraph Loved it Surprised at outcome Realized a change was coming and felt so sad Will read more of his books
My granddaughter 12 suggested it Good conversation afterwards  We decided to mention other possibles I can't write any more Oy
So beautifully written with touches of humor to lighten but such incredible depth as well One I will remember for some time to come
John Green tells a beautiful story of love loss and even hope The Fault in Our Stars is one of best books I've read in a long time
This book is so perfect  It is so magically depressing I can't get over it  It was a privilege to have my heart broken by this book
This book was a page turner and a pleasant read While some parts of the book seemed highly idealistic the book as a whole was great
This book has heart and soul with realistic characters and deep understanding of the effects of cancer on patients and their families
Real honest loved itI was weary of this books cancer element but I'm glad I read it anyway fell in love with Augustus
this book is really inspiring to me I teared up during some parts then giggled with others I just wish Augustus wouldn't have died

This book is moving inspiring and highly entertainingI recommend this book for both adults and high school readersEnjoy

When we get to share love - no matter how messed up our lives may be we are blessed The dialogue of Hazel and Augustus is delightful
Omg this book was the best ever But what I can't believe is he has to die If anything you should of had him die with her at the end
I highly recommend this book It is so good and so inspiring Be expected to cry Unless you are cold hearted This book is amazing

This book was such an amazing journey to read It was all so perfectly fit together Defiantly worth the money it's a great love story
Beautiful story that intertwined love and death in a beautiful way I wish the Amsterdam trip was longer and described in more detail
I believe this incredible novel in this generation's 'Catcher in the Rye' It is a simple book filled with awe-inspiring observations
There is not much that John Green writes that I don't love I even follow him and his brother on youtube Excellent workkeep it up
This was a very touching love story Great cast of characters Great plot; it flowed very well making it a quick read Loved this one

Such a great book with a very descriptive detail and keeps you on your toes Very sad very happy but a very good suspenseful read
This book made me smile laugh cry fear love &amp; a plethora of other emotions in just 300 &amp; something pages  A book worth reading

I enjoyed the book very much  While reading the book you can only assume how it is going to end but that is not how it ends at all
I generally steer clear of tear jerkers but this was worth the reading despite the saddness Really enjoyed the characters
Characters &amp; Subjects:  Cancer Sickness Pain Death and LOVEMy good friend &amp; fellow reading palgood going John Green
The best teenage cancer romance you'll ever read No sarcasm there - read this It's short too you'll finish it in a couple of days

Enjoyable YA fictionsome predictability for those of us older than the protagonists in the story but a sweet story nonetheless
I was SURE that I wasn't going to end up in tears over this bookI was wrong Very touching and well written and a very quick read
An amazing book It's both poetic sad and a little humorous 5 stars My mind is stars that I can not fathom into constellations
This book shows that even through tough times you can still love Even if u did not make a mark on the word you still changed a life
In my opinion the book didn't live up to all the hype there were some really funny parts but overall I felt like I wanted more
I love every single thing about this book - although it made me cry the story is so profound and I could read it over and over again

Heartfelt book that turns the view of puppy love upside down  Would read it again as much as Hazel read the story of Anna
I knew this was  going to be a tear jerker but never  expected to find  humor and immense love wrapped up in this perfect book
This book was amazing It will be complicated for kids but for teens or adults it is perfect When you start you won't want to stop
Unbelievable and deep thoughts Lobed every minute or the book now ready to see the movie Remember to leave our mark upon the world
This book was amazing I recommend this book mostly to female readers It is very heart touching This book also has very sad parts
I really enjoyed this story and even though it is quite sad it is funny and contemporary too  You are never too old for young love
Funny sad real and deep A different perspective on cancer thoughts Very well written reads smoothly Great book for discussions
I chose a four star rating The book is thought provoking as to sometimes life takes a different turn than we expect or want from it
Saw the movie first and the book is not far off as with most post-book movies Heart-wrenching at times but gives great perspective
what great perspective from cancer patients especially young ones  I can't imagine facing death at that age  GOD bless us everyone
Excellent read I read this in just one day because it was so good I haven't seen the film but the book is definitely worth the buy
Real feelingsThis book gave a look into how people especially teens with their lives ending too soon deal with real emotions I
Transcends genre - one of the great books A good book entertains A great book explains you to yourself (Be prepared with tissues)
This book is written with such simplicity everyone can understand; and yet expresses such deep emotions You won't regret reading it
I am hoping the movie does the book justiceI would definitely read more of John Green's books Makes you ponder your own life
I was very into the book couldn't stop turning pages and flowing through it I connected with characters and then felt disappointed
This was an amazing emotional book  For me to write anything else about it as a non-writer would not be fair to the book itself :)
I so wanted to read this book before the movie can out  This book made me cry/laugh and sometime scream  It was worth the emotions
I'm not much of a reader but I finished this book in one day  I couldn't manage to put it down Definitely a must read for everyone
Beautifully tragic yet undeniably something that will reach deep into the reader's soul and inspire even the most callous of heart s

You know the ending but you cry anywayLots of English Major jokes included Excellent sarcastic writing Russian lit not included
this is the best book I have read in a very long timeIt doesn't have a happy ending but life isn't always happy It's sweet despair

Don't over think about seeing the movie or reading the book but make sure you read the book because you will learn something from it
This book will move you to tears It has wonderful triumphs and horrifying downs You feel for the characters You enter their world
This book was amazing I took it as a love story and that is how i want it to go with my life (but us growing old instead of dieing)
All I say is that it's amazing Read and learn from it It is amazingly powerful and a great love story along with many life lessons

John Green is such an amazing author This book was well written and brought a difficult topic out for discussion Would recommend
I wanted more to this book I wanted to know how it really endseven though it's fictionAmazon wants more words
The book is better than the movie since it has shortened the scenes to what would fit for 2 hours But always will be my favorite
But not spectacular like I thought it would be It's not like it's predictable or anything I just would've liked to see more depth
Freakin long and boring Most of the book is just endless portrayals or everyday situations without any meaning for the big story
Great story nothing amazing but easy read Catches your attention from the beginning all the way until the end Would def recommend
A beautifully crafted story about all that matters It made me both laugh and cry out loud  I would recommend for teens and older

to be able to have even this small glimpse into the thoughts of those with terminal illness and those closest to them was humbling
This book was hard to put down once you started reading it  Such a great story and a boy and girl meeting and struggling together
I read the entire book in one evening  It is a gut-wrenching yet inspiring love story  This will definitely be a re-read for me
This book is so amazing It's not just about cancer it's about love and that at the end of the day everything happens for a reason
Breath taking book Would definitely recommend everyone read Not much of a reader for romantic books but was really inspirational
Puts much into perspectivegives light to how blessed anyone is that has their healthEasy to read no dictionary required

It was a very fantastic book I absolutely love john green as an author and I can't wait to see this book turned into a movie
It was a phenomenally heart wrenching story John Green stayed away from cliche love stories and put this in a category of its own
I've read love novels beforebut this was magnificentI could not stop reading i loved it and i will read it againg someday
I got this book as a gift for my daughter She loved this book and couldn't stop reading it I love when I can get my kids to read
Not better than Looking for Alaska but it's a close second I love the name Augustus and probably going to name my kid after him
Another John Green classic-I didn't want it to end His modern yet poetic love story is inspiring that I would recommend to anyone
Oh my godOh my godOh my godOh my god This book made me cry for the first time in over a yearOh my god
Wow That was crazy good Might be one of the most honest books and one of the most realistic book I have read in a very long time
I loved this book It's very funny very thought provoking very genuine and very sad All at the same time I'm going to miss it
This is forever my favorite novel John Green you are amazing Have not found a flaw in any of this I recommend this to everyone
John Green writes a piece so fantastic that one would be willing to trade their position with Hazel and Gus just for their relief
I was surprised that I liked this book  It even made me cry  First book I have read by this author I will read more of his work
Such a heartwarming story It is definitely a book that you need to buy and experience for yourself what everyone is talking about
This book was one I couldn't put down  It was equal parts sad as it was beautiful about first love and loss  This is a must read
Smart and funny and sad Well rounded read Made me cry a little at the end but worth it Would reccomend to others of all ages
This is an excellent book It tells a beautiful heart-wrenching story of two teenagers that you will definitely fall in love with
A great story about young people who show great courage while facing cancer A lot of twists and turns and the spirit of optimism
The first chapters dragged on a bit but once I got to the middle I was hooked I'd fall asleep trying to finish the book each night
Our narrator Hazel meets Augustus in a cancer support group her lungs have been ravaged by the disease and her constant companion is the oxygen tank she wheels along beside her Augustus is a cancer survivor and former basketball player who lost the lower half of one of legs to the disease These are bright inquisitive kids full of the smart quippy dialogue that seemed to be muttered by actresses like Emma Stone or to date myself Janeane Garofalo Yet I think what makes the book so poignant is in this current culture of social media and instant celebrity faced with ones own mortality the question is asked How will I leave a mark how will I be remembered Did my life however long or short matter
I don't think a book has ever been written as beautifully as this one and made me feel this way So happy and sad at the same time
The book was nothing I expected which is prob why I enjoyed it so much  I hope others like myself will share the same experience
What a touching funny heart wrenching story Loved it and hugged my two blessedly healthy kids a little harder after reading it
I did not fall head over heals like very one else but it was well written and the characters were well developed an emotional read
I enjoyed the book because I enjoy reading about a love so advanced the kind of love that Augustus and Hazel have for each other
For some reason Gus and Hazel just draw me in  I love their sense of humor and their interactions  Just a very enjoyable story
This book was filled with drastic twists and turns It shows that when you love somebody you should love them with all your heart
Anticlimacticok if you're into teen romance I guessI only read it because one of my book club members selected it
It was amazing definitely recommend adolescents to read this It's the most heart warming book ever It's sad but funny at times
Heart felt story that I could not put down I recommend this book highly Just loved the characters now I have to watch the movie
Well written a book that make you examine your life and  contribution to the human race  Read the book before watching the movie
I love this book although it was quite sad in some parts You can't beat their love always vibrant and it shows Definitely a 5/5
I really enjoyed this book I loved the characters and how they were young but with very real depth of emotion Sad yet beautiful
A wonderfully insightful look into the minds of those terminally ill  What they see feel and how they cope with the day to day
Love the story love the book Would read it again and again if I had time too Great author Going to look into more of his work
This book was amazing Love is a wonderful &amp; powerful thing &amp; this book captured it beautifully I hope the movie is just as good
I loved the real ness amongst all the fiction Lots of raw emotion mixed with laughable momentsI would recommend this book
If you like cute and romantic this book will do you good It's very heartwarming and heartbreaking But overall a good quick read
Good easy book Enjoyed reading it Without spoiling the ending the ending just seemed to me like it happened a bit too abruptly
It's amazing that they got to experience so much love in a such a short time that most people don't experience in a whole lifetime
Well written but the disease stuff gave me the  heebie jeebies If you are looking for a happy story you can leave this one alone
It will make you laugh it will make you cry and it will make you question the way you've been living your life It is wonderful
I knew it would be sad but not many books actually make me cry - but what a fantastic book  Beautifully written and captivating
A great read A beautiful love story Cancer sucks It's rude and doesn't care about who it claims Who it tortures Cancer sucks
Put off reading this because I though it would be a downerI was wrong Very enjoyableVery sweet I am glad I read it
Heartfelt hysterical paradigm altering I laughed cried yelled and cried some more I recommend this book to EVERYONE I meet
Liked the novel it was good I found the middle section about Amsterdam and the obsession with the Author a little long and boring
Amazing Read it in one sitting Would recommend this book to all my friends Beautifully written Will read it again and again
Such a great book Keep your tissues handy I liked that it helped me to understand how it must feel to be a cancer kid
Your book is amazing I loved it so much I hope you write another one like it The book is so good I read it 4 times  By Payton
I'm a three  time Cancer survivor  This is the first book that I've read about how other people  would deal with their prognosis
So Good Captures the essence of being a teenager while offering perspective on what's really important and the brevity of life
omg this book is amazing I hardly read and I finished this book and cried almost the whole timeI would rate this book 5stars
Simply beautiful many tears shed toward the end but once I started the book I couldn't stop reading as am typing this at 4 am
Not the typical love story but nonetheless a love story that looks at life and death in not totally predictable ways I liked it
Great book The way the story is written allows the readers to fall in love with the characters and to understand their struggles
Enlightening and sad  Why am I being required to write a review by this Kindle App before letting me read something else
Captivating story of love and death Easy to gobble without even thinking considering there are plenty of really bright thoughts
A great read portraying the strength and courage of young cancer patients while keeping their sense of humor  Hard to put down
I read this for Morgan my beautiful healthy granddaughter Thank you Jesus I love her so very much She is someone to be proud of
Didn't know much about the book bought it because of 45 star rating and found not that interesting to deserve such a high rating
I read this book because my 15 yr old daughter asked me too In her words  it's an awesome story dad she was 100 percent right
This book is the best I have ever read and I strongly recommend it to everyone John Green is just amazing and an amazing author
Wanted to read the book before seeing the movie Like the authors style and characterizations and can hardly wait to see the movie
I loved this book The characters are well developed and complex I finished the book a week ago and I am still thinking about it
Very touching Very emotionally driven A must read One of the only books that has ever made me cry and laugh at the same time
I could relate to the characters and conditions in this story  Thought the perspective from the dying persons view was well done
This was a very good book it made me laugh cry a little think and it was just a good story John Green props to you man :D

This book was amazing  Green has a way with words and building interesting characters  I will be looking into more of his books
Made me pause and remember that teenagers/young adults really do know how to love  also loved the parents charactersgood book
I knew the story would be a sad one but I was pleasantly surprised by the comedic relief and the enjoyable voice of the character
The story was interesting but so very emotional to read  I had to keep blinking to read from the moment he told her he was dying

I loved this book I read it two days I stayed up until eleven reading and just cried myself to sleep in was so sad but I love it
A truly amazing story The world really is not a wish granting factory but having humor along the way makes it so worth the ride
A love story that makes you believe that someone loving you deeply gives you strength and loving someone deeply gives you courage
John Green is an amazing writer I also read looking for Alaska too NICE JOB JOHN YOU DID AN AMZING JOB WITH ALL OF YOUR BOOKS
Would recommend this book to anyone  A great readlooking forward to the movie and hoping it does this wonderful book justice

All I have  to say about this truly wonderful book is that: it's truly wonderful A sad yet amazing little infinity love story
The books shipped fast and had good quality The book came with no bends or folds in the cover which impressed me Great read too
My grandson shared this book with meVery touching and certainly thought provoking Glad that I did not let this slip away
Something about it was too good Sounds strange and I can't explain what I mean  I liked it a lot but didn't love it as expected
This was a quick and easy read; a bit predictable but still a great story about two young people going though a terminal illness
I didn't expect to like it--I'm over 65--but it hooked me and I had difficulty reading the last half through the tears in my eyes
One of the best books I've read in a long while Funny sad and everything in-between Loved it I was hooked from the first page
It is nice to read a book about cancer that both adults and young adults can learn something from; the characters felt real to me
It was a little bit of a slow start for me but in the end I LOVED this book  Excellent dialogue easy read I laughed and cried
This  book is the best book  I've ever read I strongly encourage everyone of any age to read it because it is set up beautifully
A depressing story that you can't put downthe author sugar coats nothing  The myriad of poetry references are awesome as well
This book was a quick enjoyable read  The characters were well-developed and entertaining  It was a sad story but a great one
Seemed very real and makes you think about your life - puts things into perspective Tear jerker In a way but still intelligent
After reading this book we go around wondering about every little choice we ever made asking ourselves what would it have been
Touched my heart Epic romantic love story  This book gave me a forever in a minimal amount of chapters  and I am very grateful

Beautiful love story but get your tissues ready  Hard to put the book down especially the last half  You'll love Hazel and Gus
An unconventional love story written beautifully I could not stop reading and almost praying for the life of Hazel and Augustus
AWESOME  This should be required reading for EVERYONE  Well written from the very beginning Can't wait to read his other books

It was completely amazing even if it did make me think about my mortality and cry Absolutely amazingly beautifully incredible
I really enjoyed the characters in this story and their unique perspectives on living and dying Wonderful fun and touching read

Brilliantly written¬∑A wonderful story of young infinite love‚Ä¶a great insight into another side of living with cancer a must read
A straight forward look at what it is to be different and incurably sick A love story as touching and tragic as Romeo and Juliet
After reading the review in Time magazine I decided to read this book  I teach in a middle school so young adult books sometimes draw my attention  Some who review this book with only one star are concerned about the cancer facts and their accuracy or about the imperfect logic of some events  That is not the purpose of a novel - for ANY age  I love that this book takes cancer patients and makes them human  Gives them teen interests and thoughts that go beyond their worries about cancer  I think the author has given some insight into the lives of the characters and their real-life counterparts that can benefit any reader  My book will be donated to our school library with high recommendations
Really a good book hard to put down Could easily be a work of non-fiction As a nurse I can tell you that it was so realistic
OMG that says it all My daughter just rated this an 8/10- only because it was sad I rate this 10/10 - because it is realistic
Living large while dying  Not a dry eye in the house  John Green can make a grown woman cry  I feel for theYoung adults
I really enjoyed the easy read The story was feltit made me cryit made me laugh I would recommend this story to young adults
This was such an outstanding book  I loved it and would recommend it to anyone looking to read a well written honest love story
This book was my first time that I readed in English It was easy to understand and the the history is very romantic I loved it
I am not a young adult I am a person who read every saccharine 70's book about dying young This is not one It is a great book
What a wonderfully written story I had a long wait to borrow this  It was worth the wait   Now like Hazel I want the sequel
I loved the whole story Of course nobody wants there to be death but that's what makes it real It's everywhere and inevitable
It's heart breaking with an amazing romantic love story It's an awful ending but shows how amazing a person can be in your life
I could not put this book down I wanted to know what was going to happen next This heart warming story will bring you to tears
I chose a 5 star because thus book really touched my heart and it was just beautifulLove this book  I recommend this book
As I sit here in bed at 3:19am on a Tuesday morning with tears running down my face all I can think is that this book is amazing
Who would think about two teenagers with cancer falling in love  A funny and bittersweet story  I highly recommend reading it
A very touching story This book is impossible to put down once you start it I would recommend this to adult readers of any age
I had cried when I had read that Augustus died after he had fallen in love Hazel had finally lived life looking past her cancer
This was an amazing book I finished in under a week Never cried though but still I loved it I suppose on to the next book
beautifully written book very sad - almost used a whole box of tissues and couldn't put the book down definitely worth reading
I LOVE THIS BOOK It is so emotional I cried laughed and did every other felling there is throughout this book I hope u luv it
What an amazing book such a great story of the reality that comes along with terminal illness Beautiful story of love and loss
Hope where there doesn't seem a reason to look best hope finder places ever   I had given up thereby  reading  a teenaged novel
Thus book was honestly amazing It gives an amazing story and is sad at some  points and I am so glad I read this fantastic book
Sweet story of love life and death Obviously written to really pull at the heartstrings of romantic teenagers and young adults
This story touched my heart on so many levelsboth as a mom to 2 young daughters and as a love story built on strong character
An excellent account of cancer patients feelings  A real life story that is funny and also very sad  I really liked this book
BOOK IS BETTER THAN THE MOVIE OF COURSE THEY LEFT SOO MUCH OUT IN THE MOVIE ALTHOUGH THE MOVIE DID ITS PURPOSE MAKE YOU WEEEP
Thank you Mr Green for the book that will change my life forever and I will see to that I read many more of your amazing books
I never Cry during books or movies But this one hit hard There was no question i was just sitting there crying  AMAZING BOOK
This boom was really good Lots of laughs a few cries and it just seems to make you think about your life and what you are doing
Superbly written and straightforward Pulls on the heart strings but not tritely so A quick must-read for any age or background
Full of irony Made me laugh Changed my personal perspective and teaches a lesson you won't forget Be grateful and always love
Loved this book  Beautiful take on what ppl really think when sick Drew you right into the story as you were living it ad well
Excellent read now must see the movie  Ending was different than expected and not sure if better or not - sad on all accounts
it is a wonderful and life affirming story of love and growth through challenge I loved it and the characters spoke to my heart
I LOVE LOVE love that they found LOVE but the way it ended was so so so sad for me but this is the best part I've read in forever
Though written by an adult the language and emotions portrayed are those of a teen grown up too fast A page turner with insight
It is great I just wish that I had known if Hazel Grace died or not I love entirely but that is the only thing I wished to know
I enjoyed this book It seems like young adult fiction to me I wonder what happens to Hazel It is a good choice for a teenager
I just love it That is all Thanks John Green RIP Augutus Waters Hazel is amazing Everything about the book is I love tfios
It was a sad and happy book also living in Indianapolis it was a fun read because the places they spoke of are close to my home
I couldn't put this book down Would definitely recommend this book to others Make sure you have  a box of Kleenex handy though
I thought this book was OK It was slightly predictable I am however veer fond ofJohn Green's history videos on Youtube
The Fault In Our Stars is a completely great book within it's own I highly recommend it to people who are thinking about buying
that is love not the crap the media shows these days i fell in love with this book as you fall asleep; slowly then all at once
You fall in love with the characters their eccentricity and their refreshingly different takes on the world and our place in it
Good teeny- bopper book Haven't seen the movie cause generally books are better anywayI enjoyed it and I'm almost 40 lol
Absolutely loved this book Very well written Depressing but really makes you see life a different way Can't wait for the movie
That's allIf you don't read this novel you will surely miss outGet it NowI'm sorry I didn't read it sooner
what happens to Anna's mom what happens to Isaac What happens to her mother What happens to her Please wander the questions
I was excited for this  book after hearing many good reviews It was not a life changing story but was a good read none the less
This book is simply awe inspiring intellectually stimulating and above all tear jerking You absolutely have to read it okay
A true love story  We should all be so lucky I would recommend this book to all who want to feel good and sad at the same time
I have watched the movie and read the book I usually watch the movie and don't take the time to read books I'm glad I did both
If you want a book that will make you laugh and cry at the same time then this is the perfect book I loved it Great ending too
Enjoyable over all definitely emotional pretty good Some of the over wordy-Ness of it gets tiring but that's probably just me
What a beautiful book amazing to readI'm hoping that my niece would love it too help her understand about life and taking t
What a beautiful love story of two souls who found each other during pretty dark times I didn't want it to end okay
This is a very thought provoking book I thoroughly enjoyed reading it through tears and laughter a perfect balance of emotion
Gus and Hazel' s love story is definitely not a typical one  Unfortunately for them they will never have a forever kind of love
Thought the book was slow and not much meatThe part about van horn was just too muchShould have been a shorter book
It was intriguing emotional and well written I read it within a couple days and thoroughly enjoyed it Definitely recommend it
Best book I have read in a while If you think this book is to sad to read well maybe it is but that does not mean don't read it
I was somewhat disappointed I've heard many people talk about how good this book was but I feel like it could have been better

Witty acerbic surprising story development and author writes very well from a female's perspective This 56 year old loved it

Can't wait for the movie  The book keeps you on the edge of your seat Loved it beyond words One of the best reads the summer
This is a touching story and one i would definitely recommend to anyone looking for a love story or even just some great writing
Loved the story-line looking forward to the movie Wish all teenagers would read this book to learn about life love and family
I found this book to be just okay It kept my interest but it was fairly predictable I can see why it appeals to young readers
I couldn't put this book down I loved the quirky characters and the insight into the minds of cancer and all of it's struggles
Oh my It was a real tear jerker I laughed I cried It felt like a real life story You would never believe that it was made up
Leaves you wanting moreI real tear jerkerDefinitely a story that needs to be read by all teens and young adults

I loved it and I am in my 70's I can't wait to see the movie My grandaughter suggested I read it and I called to thank her when
Don't have to say much more  I cried a lot More than I should over fictional characters But that's John green for you I guess
although I saw this ending coming I still felt like I was robbed of a more descriptive ending But like I said  I saw it coming
Beautifully written and wonderfully told I can't wait to read more books by john green The movie will be difficult to compare
We'll written and kept  me reading even though I suspected a sad ending  Depressing especially for someone going through cancer
One of the best books I have read in a while its an experience i can relate to The characters are smart and tell a great story
I enjoyed this book  I felt a good connection with the characters I also liked how he put a different spin on dying and cancer

5 stars a wonderful story It is nothing but a romance with a twist If your looking for a romance  book I recommend this to you
A compelling story about love and loss Though might seem cruel and cliche gives it's own personal identity Leaves you in awe
Ostensibly an adolescent novel but with so many layers and levels that it's really a brilliant novel for adults as well Bravo
BEST BOOK IN THE ENTIRE UNIVERSE ALL PF JOHN GREENS BOOKS ARE AN INSIGHT INTO THE TRUTH OF LIFE AND EMBODY THE LIFE OF TEENAGERS
I just adore this book By far one of the best It was filled with excitement tragedy and love It was also very well written
Although this is a young adult book I read it and really liked it  It read quick of course but the content was so meaningful
A great tear jerker and rumors are being spread about a movie coming out so get a hold of this read before the movie comes out
Excellent read and amazing story I enjoyed it so much that I'm downloading his other books now  Can't recommend highly enough
A surprisingly good book  It's one that seems to come to an end too soon  It is about cancer so be prepared to cry throughout
This is a touching book with unexpected twists It feels like its geared toward teens rather than adults But it was enjoyable
One of the most honest love stories ever told  Love loss and coping with terminal illness are all part of this beautiful read
This is an excellant book  I enjoyed each pagewell written and such a fantastic story  Thanks for telling it to all of us
So you read that it's about a girl with cancer and you figure I've got enough hardship in my own life What do I need with this noise But here's the magic of John Green's book Yes it has sadness in it but it celebrates life in an amazing and uncompromising way It's intelligent and beautiful I've read how others read it and alternately laugh and cry and I must admit I did that too on numerous occasions But the crying is not because it's some depressingly weepy Oprah book club wannabe You fall in love with the characters in this novel -- even the scumbag Dutch-American author It reiterates that life is ultimately finite but it will make you want to live it to the fullest Read this book
A close friend of mine got a signed copy for her birthday and when she showed me the book I SCREAMEDI have read all of John Green's books and there are just no words to describe the awesomeness that has been distilled into this book John made me go through a rollercoaster of emotions and as a young adult who lost her dad from cancer it gave me a sort of closure that I needed I stray away from reading novels involving teenagers falling in love but John Green's works delve deeper than other young adult fiction books This book definitely deserves a place on my collection of books that needs to be passed down to my childrenJohn and Hank Green you give me hope :')DFTBA
This book was chosen in as part of a book club that I belong to and is the first time I've read John Green's work  When I first glanced at the summary I thought it would be a heartwrenching story of this young womans battle with cancer  Instead it was about a remarkably smart young woman who happens to be dying of cancer quite flippantly at that  I fell in love with Hazel's  wit and outlook on her circumstance  When she met Augustus - he was just too much of a force of life to resist  They along with their friend Isaac had me laughing rooting for them and crying  I have so many highlighted excerpts on the kindle I'm looking forward to my bookclub discussion  It will be a good one
Sometimes you read books and you couldn't care less about what happens to the characters Other times the characters in a book come alive and you feel like you know them This book falls into the latter category Augustus and Hazel seem so real I laughed out loud at parts and got all teary-eyed at other parts I bought the Kindle edition of this book I rarely highlight quotes from books on my Kindle but I highlighted probably a quarter of the book because there were so many quotes I wanted to remember This book definitely made me stop and think about life which rarely happens with any books even the so-called good ones It is a great book and deserves the glowing reviews it has gotten
So I've read nearly every book by John Green He's easily my favorite author so of course walking into this I highly suspected I would not be disappointed but I did not expect it to be this wonderful either His books generally help people relate or feel like someone understands them but this book was making you fall in love with these people then wrench them away It makes you love them laugh with them and cry when things take turns you never expected It is easily one of the best purchases I've ever made I read it within 24 hours but it's two weeks later and I'm still carrying it around with me Thank you for writing such beauty and thank you for understanding us &lt;3 nerdfighters
[edit]Need a good cry If yes then this is the book to read It's a beautiful sad love story This is a must read
I didn't watch the show Read the sample on kindle and decided to purchase Enjoy it a sad but happy story reflecting on life

I loved this book it was beautiful literature I couldn't stop reading it Every time you read a new page something shocked you

I thought TFIOS was well written I look forward to re-reading it I have recommended it to both of my grown daughters as well
Interesting read for all ages As anyone can guess it is a tear jerker so have some tissue on hand towards the end of the book
This book began terminal and took sight and life from others It was an easy read but I won't be going to see it in the movies
This book makes you fall in love with characters Enjoyable and page turning novel Well written It is an easy and short read
Hard to put down Interesting twists in the plot Characters are very intelligent and well read Excited to see the movie now
Like most of you I imagine I also want to know what happened to Hazel and to Isaac I think the point is that we are not meant
Amusing and touching life is never long enough for anyone we love even a century goes by too fast and the end comes suddenly
I don't usually like books that aren't in the fantasy genre but this one was amazing :) I just wish it would have been longer
It surprised amused and amazed me  The depth of the characters dealing with such difficult to accept challenges was riveting
LOVED this book A very tragic beautiful love story that no movie will ever do justice I teared up throughout the whole thing
First time reading John Green plan to read many more of his stories Can't wait to see the movie need to bring a box of tissues

It really shows the meanings of life It's such an intense read that you go through it so quickly I only wish it had a sequel
I finished the book in a day and it was amazing I cried and almost threw my phone but I loved the book and hope to read more
Predictable story line Characters are all witty regardless of circumstance Had to stop reading 3/4 of the through Not for me

Don't get me wrong it was very well written  i just like a book that I am not crying every single chapter  Very well written

This was a good book  Read quickly but no twists and turns or unpredictable events  Written very well  I would recommend it
Suitable fo both adult and mature teenage readers A warm and inspiring novel With hope courage sincere friendship and love
This was my first John Green book I have heard mixed reviews on his books and the levels of content in them so I was a little skeptical before picking this up The story starts a little slow not too slow though and is just interesting enough to propel you into the next chapter After a chapter or so I found myself not wanting to stop reading literally This book is mesmerizing in more ways than one The characters are all realistic and you are sure to fall in love with each and every one of them for some reason or another the story is straight forward but still keeps you guessing and the emotions in this book are plentiful This is a book I think everyone should read at least once
There are plenty of reviews outlining the story but I loved this book so much that I had to say so  The main characters Hazel and Gus are smart and witty; perhaps they know too much for being teenagers but if you can overlook that you will be treated to not just their story but their amazing outlook on life They want their lives to count for something to be remembered after they are gone and to leave as few scars as they can I laughed out loud at their humor enjoyed their romance contemplated life and the universe and cried my eyes out while being unable to set the book down The Fault in Our Stars is easy to read while being intelligent and full of truth  Two thumbs up
My reaction when I finished this book: Oh My God I think this book literally changed my perspective on life It's so tragically beautiful that after you read the last words you sit there in complete silence and rethink everything over and start to cry in both despair and relief I usually am not one to cry over books but The Fault in Our Stars had me sobbing Augustus' and Hazel's love is so pure and true The whole book even though it is fiction is so honest about love and life My thoughts about this book are thoughts I cannot fathom into constellations I recommend this book to anyone and everyone young or older this book is completely and utterly amazing&lt;3333
Sad for the sake of being sad I may be scoring it lower because I feel like the crying it induced ruined an entire weekend
Make sure you have a box of tissues close by  It's a wonderful love story to make you appreciate the ones you love even more
A great story Funny charming and heart-wrenching So much better than the movie But aren't all books ;-) highly recommend
It was well written dealing with different personalities their struggles and how each approach themselves as well as others
This is my fifth time reading it and I cry each time I'm going to go look at memes now even though my sadness is inconsolable
Enjoyed it immensely The characters were very believable and there were lots of good laughs Thanks John Green for this book
Have a completely different view on death and life Makes you think about what is important and what makes a life worth living
Awesome read Would love a sequel so I can find out about Hazel and her journey with her cancer and Isaac and their friendship
Such a deep beautifully written book I feel like any compliment I give will not do it any justice but only marr its beauty
Characters were well developed and plot was unexpected The author invests time to make you feel like you know them as people
I absolutely love how honest this book is It's one of the best books I've read and I'd definitely recommend it to my friends
It was a good book but has some language that is not what kids should be reading but it's a good read  There is also a movie
I read the paper back book around a year ago and then I read this and it was nothing like the real book don't bother buying it
Sad but beautifully written and a wonderful love story We should all be loved like this  Thank you for sharing this story

Good easy read I don't typically pick novels like this but  I thoroughly enjoyed it Easy to read and hard to put down

Not a typical choice for the woman who seeks mass hysteria and armageddon-based novels But I'll tell ya what it got me good
Incredible bookThe only thing I might have changed is the ending A better ending might have wrapped the book up better
This book takes you a sensory journey that stimulates your witty funny bone while pulling at your compassionate heart strings

This is a great book  I will warn you that it is very hard to put down The characters are very real  I highly recommend it

Readable story - less of a tearjerker than it might have been  Kids a bit too clever and story tries to hard to be different
It was so good and greatly written It had a beautiful balance of both happiness and sadness I would definitely recommend it
This was an excellent read Never a dull moment My heart was filled broken and refilled I hope you willread it and enjoy
Can't wait for the movie Hopefully half as decent as the book It's a great read Really recommend it to hopeless romantic :)

Sometimes I try to imagine the perfect book But hey this is it The fault on our stars is not the constellations ourselves
John Green is an amazing writer The story  is incredible WARNING :If you have a heart you will cry Can't wait for the movie
I'm practically bawling This is a great read I'm from Indy so I'm local to this story but WOW a great piece of writing
Beautiful witty tear jerking and last but not least thought provoking I felt like I was in love again Thank you John green
Enjoyed the book definitely shed some tears but I won't spoil it for you It was a good story and kept me engaged to the end
I really enjoyed this book  I thought the characters were developed well and the story was interesting as well as realistic
Be prepared to cry And some uncomfortable first hand accounts of witnessing two teenagers losing their v cards But beautiful
Our country is being  dumbed down and is not paying attention to anything that is going on We need to read this book to understand WHY we have ll been duped and sold a bill of goods on all this PC junk we are cow-towing to which is crap So many Americans walk along don't knowing don't caring about anything except what they have going on in their lives They don't care about our country they don't care about our men and women who are serving this country they could care less if this whole country goes to Hell and it is headed in that direction  Wake up America Read this book and see what a puppet you have become see how dumb you are and do something about it
The book is outstanding This is the first of Green's books I have read and the first fiction novel I have finished since reading Harry Potter in high school (I'm now through undergrad and bouncing through the job market) The book's very relatable and likable characters take you on a very fun ride with laughs deep thought and pain The book is an easy read with an occasional wild card word that only requires a quick dictionary look-up and reread This all made the book hard to put down and I finished it in one sitting It was definitely good enough to read again something I do not really ever do and it has reintroduced me to the joy of reading Thank you John Green -Brian
The Fault in Our Stars by John Green is awesome - in the sense that it is awe inspiring The book pulls you into the story of Augustus and Hazel making you feel every emotion that they do and more In the book its self there was a quote: Sometimes you read a book and it fills you with a weird evangelical zeal and you become convinced that the shattered world will never be put back together unless and until all living humans read the book That is how I would describe thisI highly recommend buying this book I know it seems odd but I bought both the eBook and the hardback (I like to have my favorite books in actual book form) It is a worth while purchase I promise you
So unbelievably sad but I really enjoyed it It was definitely really hard for me too because my son is a cancer survivor
Such a wonderful storyline Beautiful and romantic all in one I disappeared into a puddle tears from this book Beautiful

I love the author's writing style Good quick read Gets you thinking Definitely makes me open my eyes to my world and life
Very sweet story I enjoyed the characters and their depth The ending was perfect for the inevitable fate of the characters
This book was so amazing that I just HAD to write a review for itI had seen this book around for around for awhile and I never stopped to read the description or even look at it Not even realizing I was missing out So a few days ago I decided to pick it up And I am so glad that I didI just felt that Hazel and Augustus story was so beautiful yet so tragic I felt so connected to them like I was experiencing whatever they were going through It's not very often that I feel this way about characters I laughed with them cried with them and so onIn the end I loved The Fault in our Stars and I will definitely read it again (hopefully with less tears) :)
I love this book  I'm 46 years old (so not a teen) and although this is a story of first/young love it is not written just for a younger audience  It allows you to see all the characters thru the main characters eyes Hazel but since she is clearly beyond her own years her take on things is very accurate and adult-like and true  So you get a real understanding of the heartache and love her parents have towards herhow people around her see her It reminds me quite a bit Juno and I picture her character to be very similar in fact  Funny very touching and just a really really great book  Not a cancer story Highly recommend to mid-teens that like to read &amp; up
i loce this book it is wity ND FUNNY AND HAS A REALISTIC ENDING THANK YOU JOHN GREEN FOR GIVING JS THE PLEASURE OF THIS BOOK
It's a great read and it is funny and sad but anyone during the ages of 13 and older will love this book And it has romance

All I can say after reading this beautiful intelligent well written novel John Green wrote an amazing story for all ages
It was sad funny beautiful the complete package of what should be in a book I loved it I'm on my way to rent the movie
Heart warming  Heart Rending  More than a story  A philosophical reflection on death and living and cancer  A must read
I love this book much much better than the movie  I usually hate recalling and this book has got me actually liking reading
Totally lovable characters I laughed(out loud) and cried while reading this book Highly recommended Very emotional story
Set in the time and space between pages and between lives brought into focus by the limits of life created by cancer is love
The book had parts that made me laugh in spite of the subject matter It was a decent book that I would recommend to others
This book was amazing I gave it 5/5 stars on goodreadscom I'm excited to continue reading more of john greens other books
Not only beautiful but entirely entertaining ALL the characters are fantastic and real and i can only wish for a sequel :)
I'm speechless But I would read this a hundred more times and cry and laugh and just enjoy being speechless all over again

I was fascinated with the characters and with their mannerisms I found several thoughts worth texting to our grandchildren
This is a true winner  Some unexpected twists and turns that keep the reader plugged in and reading until the book is done
Loved this bookit was  very deep and enlightening at the same time Having health issues myself I  put a lot in perspective
I liked the details and wording I did not like how a Gustus relapsed It was kind of predictable But overall a great book
All I can say is that it was a wonderfully sweet story  I enjoyed it very much  I'd recommend it to my book lover friends
I'm not the type of person that reads a ton of books but everyone was saying that this book is great and they were all right
loved this book  very upbeat look at sad subject  very uplifting  would recommend to all to read before seeing the movie
In a world so often cruel and heartless comes a novel that reminds us of life's pinnacle experience - love Thank you John

Fast read yet a very powerful story The characters are starcrossed young kids in love battling cancerWith your time
I loved this book I laughed and cried I fell in love with Hazel Grace and Agustus Just so you know I rarely give 5 stars

Oh my god that is one of if not the best book I have ever read I cannot stop crying This is the next book you should read
I'm going to say this once BEST BOOK EVER I got this book yesterday and I absolutely couldn't put it down when I got to the part where Augustus dies I bawled like a new born baby who got their bottle taken away to soon this is a book I could read over and over again until I face my fears of oblivion and take the the fall into oblivion Okay  Okay Has to be my favorite line besides when Augustus confesses to Hazel his love for her in both when they went to Oranjee and in good letter to Peter This book is the book I made a connection with more than any other book I've ever read Thank you John green for this amazing wonderfully simple inspiring book
This is arguably one of the most beautifully written works of literature that I have read in a long time This book is truthful something that a lot of people have forgotten can exist in fiction It is a love story of course but it is about a disease a real disease and it presents the real complications of having this disease in its many different forms I will tell you in advance this book will rip your heart out and tear it into tiny little pieces but even in its saddest moments you cannot put it down Thank you John Green for presenting me with this new outlook on many things I had begun to take for granted in this life that I am so lucky to have Thank you
Young adult fiction is some of the most powerful and original out there However I do not consider this book to fit solely in that realm It is powerful and original absolutely --- but I think that it is being considered young adult based solely on the age of the protagonists This book is universally appealing It maneuvers through the heavy topics of terminal cancer and eventual death with a realistic wit and strength The execution of words combined with compelling characters will not allow you to put the book down And yes you will weep You should weep But in the end you will be rewarded with something real raw and rare for your effort Highly recommend it
I'm not going to tell what this book was about nay that would a waste of space I'm not going go tell you the deeper meaning or what the author was really trying to say I believe there is no greater insult to a work then that However in my few years of being about to devour books as I do never have I ever come across a book that speaks both of and to the human soulGreen wrote of a forever created within the limits of reality the impossible time that never exists Let me tell you in simple words this book is my forever as pretentious as that may sound Take his words to heart and if by perchance you are lucky someday they will reach your soul
An amazing book aimed at young adults to adults The book is amazingly written and makes you appreciate a lot more in life
I loved the humor and the non- sentimental expression of dying Liked how Hazel wants the best for those she leaves behind
Great book with themes about religion life and death the illusiveness of life and about the importance of relationships
So good Really beautiful Makes you reflect on life in a moving way without being a heavy text Fairly quick read as well
Ordered for one of my children They were very excited that the wait time was not long and they enjoyed the book immensely
The author portrayed a beautiful facet of life in the most devastating of arenas  The characters were honest and inviting
I always think books are better than the movie's but not this one  It's definitely a twisted plot  Hazel and Gus forever
Absolutely amazing romantic realistic story I couldn't stop reading it after the first chapter The book even made me cry
Very thought provoking about young love A fast read but emotionally packed with love and fate Would recommend to friends
This book is a reminder of all the illness in this world and esp with young ppl It's Not fair and it made me sad to read
What a great depiction of reality and cancer I cried throughout this book which gives you a beautiful insight of humanity
Good book with a great view of how patients with a terminal diagnosis want to be viewed still as people and not an illness
Very enjoyable read  Certainly a book for young teenagers but I'm a grandmother and I liked it  Hazel will be your hero
The most amazing heart felt book I have ever read I love everything about it Even the fact that it is sad and made me cry
I loved this book I'm about to read it for a second time and I honestly think that this book is a true work of art DFTBA

I thought this book would have me weepingit did not although my eyes did well up with tears at one point We'll-written
Great book you will really really really really really really really really really really really really really love it much
This book will make you cry it tells the story of two kids that has cancer and how they cope you will need a box of tissues
The story hooked me right away Even though the outcome is predestined the sensitive and realistic approach is refreshing
The Fault in Our Stars is a book that elicits many emotions but it feels real  It is well written and touches your heart
Have tissues ready after they meet Houten in Amsterdam Definitely worth the money May get sad for some particular people
This book was very insightful and actually made me laugh a few times  The dialogue is excellent  I could not put it down
Loved the characters' dry sense of humor all throughout the book  Some shocking twists but a slightly predictable ending
Amazing novel Love that it was a real life ending and not some unrealistic ending that no one in the world can relate too
Touching story loved the main characters however it was a bit predictable at parts Though i would recommend it to anyone
amazing story that makes you appreciate the world and life each and every day a true inspirational love story worthy read
What a sad yet great book The author makes the characters believable and relatable in the worst imaginable life scenario
This is definitely a good read In Very elegant and simple word the author has made us felt the possible depth of emotions

Maybe I'm getting too old  for these teenage romance books but although very well written didnt really get under my skin
This book is the perfect medium to connect with your teen Read it together and bond over this tragic beautiful love story
this is a beautifully written modern day Romeo and Juliet-esque story &lt;3 it will make you cry and laugh and cry some more
I liked the main characters and generally the philosophy  At times it seemed too contrived but death is a tough subject
Tragic and beautiful I fell in love with this book and read it in 2 days Interesting look at terminal illness and living
The recommendation came from my eleven year old granddaughter who has become a reading machine She loved it and I love it
Tfios is a great book Everyone should read it You'll learn a lot and maybe even cry This is definitely a five star book
I love this bookThe movie was so sad it made me cry Also I would recommend this book to everyone because it is wonderful

Interesting but such a sad story  I CAN'T even imagine going to see it as a movieThe whole concept was depressing
I thought this book was great and I could visualize the whole book Would definitely recommend it to more people it's great
These kids expressed the pain and joy and questions of their hearts not wanting pity but love and answers and understanding
This book carries a heavy message in a well crafted thoughtful manor I highly suggest reading this book It is fantastic

I have never wanted to read a book twice I do now This book is beautiful The characters warm smart as he'll and tragic
Read it because of the hype about it and finished in one day Not sure I'd read it again but I'm not disappointed I read it
Author wrote beautifully about the topic of fears and friendships of teenagers who just want to be like other normal teens
This book takes a very difficult topic and makes the characters very believable and they develop into people you care about
a nice quick reading book Couldn't stop once I got into it I haven't seen the movie  but I'm sure its a real tear jerker
This is an excellent young adult book Brutal truth of the world helps you to appreciate it The perfect tragic love story
Decent enough book to get through but not a stellar read This may be one where the movie is actually better than the book
I sobbed like a little girl when I read this book It's not the type of book I usually read but I'm glad I read it anyway
This book is the best book that I've read in a while Augustus and Hazel are greatly thought up by John green he is amazing

I read this book in two days I just couldn't put it down  It made me laugh and it made me cry Highly recommended read
I thought the book was good but not as good as all the hype  It was a cute book about friendship but sadly predictable

With having the unfortunate ability to have a loss for wordshow tragically beautiful this story was Thanks for the hope
Found it all a little too pretentious at times  The premise was great and the characters were wonderful  Ending broke me
The book is quite sad but good still Although some parts of the book are not as interesting as others it was still good :)
The characters were unpredictable which kept me reading Witty sad and clever all at the same time I would recommend it
Great writing  I am a Jodi Picoult fan and this is very close to her awesome stories Grabs you from the first paragraphs

There should be nothing holding you back from reading this book  Except you might want to time it when you are home alone
I enjoyed reading the story because it showed the true meaning of love Not based on how someone looks but the real person
Do yourself a favour and read this bookFantastic story and extremely well written made me laugh and cry Amazing
*Claps as I cry a million times* I'm emotionally damaged from this book because it is so beautiful  thanks Augustus Waters
All of us love this We watch / play / read it often Item was in condition as expected and there were no troubles with it
You will cry No doubt about it It makes you realize that you need to look at every detail in the world and appreciate it
I didn't want to put it down I forgot that it was about young teens while I was reading it It's a book meant for all ages
You can't stop reading it once you start It is well written funny touching hits all the emotions Definitely recommend

Great book about the heart breaking inevitable of life The aspiring lives of two teens trying to be as normal as possible

Really enjoyed this one  Get your tissues ready It's a tear jerker What a beautiful love storyAwe some setting
What an awesome story It felt like she was in my head speaking my thoughts Loved this book can't wait to see the movie
Heartbreaking For anyone that knows illness and a glimpse for those who don't You fall in love and are lost all the same
This is a great story of pain love and tragedy It will leave you heartbroken and yet grateful to feel the sting of loss
As sad as the story is (we're talking losing young lives to cancer) it was not depressing Hope the movie doesn't ruin it
Breathtaking kind of throws you Would be great to know if hazel ever grows up and gets married Sequel Maybe
Absolutely beautiful So much to be said but I will leave that for my book club In the meantime you should just read it
Read this to see if it is suitable for my kids  I'd say yes for my 14 year old no for my 11 year old Intense but honest

Beautifully written Make sure you have tissue nearby Even though it's about teenagers it's still a must read for adults
IVE NEVER CRIED SO MUCH FROM READING A BOOK ITS WONDERFUL AND LIFE CHANGING YOU WONT WANT TO PU IT DOWNüò≠üò≠üòçüëèüëèüëèüëè
YOU MUST READ THIS HEART WORMING STORY ABOUT CANCER AND HOW ITS WORTH FIGHTING FOR AUGUSTUS WATERS He will be missed ;(
The key to reading this book is an abundance of tissues It was a fantastically heartwarming story that touched me deeply
Too much crying I thought this book was for kids Easy to read enjoyable and a nice break from the horrors of real-life
I love this book Quite a tear-jerker but in the best way possible I suggest reading it when you're in need of a good cry
I loved the tone of this story Very real and clever -the characters are quite well written  Augustus is a beautiful soul
Thought it was more for teenager than adult but good story line and well written Good subject matter and held my attention
A book about cancerand a love story about 2 teenage cancer patients I didn't find it depressing at all Quite different
This was a bittersweet story of love and loss  I could relate to the mother in regards to being a caretaker to your child
I really loved The Fault in Our Stars It was easy to like all of the characters -- even as they're going through some pretty horrible circumstances John Green tells a really engrossing story that easily sweeps you in and doesn't let you go until you've come to the end shocked at the journey you've just takenAfter finishing the book I found I was haunted by the characters (in good ways) for several weeks If you have a young adult in your life who loves a good book -- clue them into this and everything else by John Green Or if you're an adult looking for a great book to read -- then get to reading because I don't think you'll be disappointed
An epic love story  A little infinity  This book is unlike anything I've ever read Look forward to reading it again
A true love story sad reality and insight meld into a peaceful but tragic outcome The characters feel real and likable
This is a beautiful but very tragic story I cried while reading and 2 days after This a book that stay with me forever
Such a nice story Love really is more pain than pleasure but the pleasure seems to linger more with these two characters
I really liked reading the book and also enjoyed the movie even though it is sad I would recommend this book to everyone
And I felt its sweet miserythis book touched my heart I love Hazel and Augustus and their abiding love for each other
A good read Heart pulling Didn't want to put it down Also an easy read and a short one at that Definitely recommend
Very well written I decided to read this book with my middle school students It was a great book to have discussions on
I enjoyed the humour in this book Aside from the gut wrenching sad parts in this book I was able to still laugh a little
I've read many books in my life I can only remember of one other that left its mark in my soul the same way this one did
This was a really well written book However I felt the ending was abrupt Another chapter would pull this together nicely
Someone who gets it  Very good book by someone who truly gets the understanding of pain and how to honestly deal with it
Way better than the movie It's a touching story of forbidden love The new aged Romeo and Juliet A must read for anyone
I got the free sample it was good but the book is so lame Their might be like a little good stuff but I gave on the book

A beautiful story of star-crossed lovers This was cancer at it's finest and a fantastic love story at that Okay Okay
This book had a very good story and very hard vocabulary You are going to need a dictionary For ages 15 at the youngest
Saddest book I've read in a long time although fiction it conveys a lot of life's truths I read it in a matter of hours
I don't usually read books like this but I am glad this was one of them Love pain and laughter what more could you want
Well written and funny for such a sad topic The characters are very well developed and likeable  Should be a good movie

I am a reader not a writer so it's difficult to write a review worthy of this book it was beautiful wrenching and real
A wonderful epic story that anyone of any age would enjoy  It made me laugh cry be excited but most if all feel alive
THIS BOOK IS SO AMAZING BUT HAS THE SADDEST ENDING IN THE WHOLE WORLD UGH ASDFGHJKL JOHN GREENS WRITING IS SO PERFECT ILY
This is one of the best books I've read in a while I love Greens writing style and I'm going to have to read more of him
I didn't find this story to be particularly believable or deep but it was an easy interesting read A little predictable
A very compelling book from the first page The development of the characters are excellent Looking forward to the movie
Good and easy read Characters were intimately written and fun to know Overall the book is a great early teen suggestion
I loved the storyline and plot I thought it was very original and touched your heart I recommend this to teens and adults
Easy read that is well worth your time Loved the book and will recommend to close friends for a quick well written read

This book is one of the best novels out there there is happiness and sadness I just want to be thankful for my boyfriend
Only book that has ever made me cry like a little bitch Very real and well written I will force my friends to read this
This was not the kind of book that I really enjoyed but I'm sure somebody else well I heard she's very good but not for me
Excellent book but you WILL cry If you have ever lost someone to cancer it will bring back lots of memories good and bad
This book was so good I couldn't stop reading it I would like to find out what happens to all the characters in the book
Just like all of John greens masterpieces; you didn't let me down In fact once again you have exceeded my expectations
Love loss laughter and wit tied together in a wonderful story that's kept me turning the pages until the very last page

Really good book and made me cry makes you think about life in general  hits home hard try it you will love it
Ever since author John Green wrote Looking for Alaska I've been a fan I've followed his works and read everything but Will Grayson Will Grayson which I hope to get to soon Nothing has quite lived up to Looking for Alaska  until now I have to say that I was very very pleased with The Fault in Our Stars Green hits on several universal themes; Hazel and Gus (the main characters) will teach readers about the risky business of life and love and grief Green holds true to his signature writing style  smart writing that isn't dumbed-down for his young adult audience He writes for teens the way they like to be treated as capable and mature
so much crying
I love this book it was so sad but charming and funny at the same time I love all John Green books especially this one
This book was one of the best books I've ever read and I recommend this book to everyone that likes sad and happy books

This book will touch you so deeply Such a strong young girl faced with unthinkable reality Beautiful story so sweet
Sad romantic story about love being powerfull enough to support when nothing else left Romantic people will enjoy that
What a haunting story  I made me think of my own life and those that I love  I hope to leave as few scars as possible
Couldn't put this down Devoured it in one day I thought for sure it would be only a sad book But it was so much more
There is not another minute promised to any of usDoes anyone else hate that there are a required number of words
Definitely worth reading I really enjoyed it and would certainly recommend it to everyone Such a tear jerker for sure
Loved the movie had to read the book Loved it even more John Green's use of voice to characterize Hazel is wonderful
I haven't seen the movie but the book was great  Well written good storyline  I Would definitely recommend this book
This is my favorite book It's so beautifully written and doesn't let people believe that there's always a happy ending
Amazing book The author shows how Hazel finds love through her depression It's a book I would recommend to everyone

As a cancer patient myself (in remission) I can honestly say that John Green captured the moments thought and feelings
Best book by far I've ever read captures everything beautifully and I would be lucky to have alittle romance like them
Make sure you have your tissues ready  This is almost a version of modern day Romeo &amp; Juliet but with a diseased twist
Amazing Fast and easy read I wouldn't recommend another book to read besides this one It's love but truth all in one
One of the best books I've read in ages Don't get distracted by the hype of the movie The book draws out real emotion
One of the best love stories I've ever read Their connection is immeasurable and infinite I love Hazel and Gus' story
Absolutely beautiful This story is inspiring and gives one hope to never give up Well done John Green Oh and DFTBA
It's very well written I love the characters but ITS SO SAD I can't give it five stars It left me depressed for days
Love comes in all stages This tale proves this through wit and circumstance I would def read it again and again
This book is amazing it is very sad but it really shows everyone things about life they never realized OUTSTANDING
I cried soo much It's really sad but in the end you know every things going to be ok It's lovely I would read it agin

Loved reading this It's a sweet story and I really got attached to the characters I looks forward to reading it again
What a great perspective on a grim subject Great for airplane or beach Geared more to the tween crown but worth a read
A bit jumbled in parts &amp; therefore hard to follow  Some of the intellectual comments should have been better explained
This book was touching and thought provoking A must read for anyone at any age Hope the movie can live up to the text
It's a great summer read and has valuable life lessons by seeing the world through the eyes of kids with terminal cancer
Everything about this book is perfection Long story short Per Fec Tion Beware of the tears just sayin Okay Okay

I loved the characters You fall in love with the language and interaction between the two main characters A must read
I'm 20% in and I just had a strong desire to go check the last page - which I would do except I'm kindling it  All I'm saying is :: shakes fist at John Green ::If I had a wish granting machine I'd wish for more books like this  It's reverent in an irreverent way  It's so insightful it hurts  It's heart breaking and elegant and lovely  As the author has said in a dodge of the question of Will this book make me cry it should make you feel all the things  It will make you feel all the thingsHazel + AugustusI need about two more stars to give this book but I guess that is the fault in these stars
This book is simply magical He takes a scenario that is relatable but un-like anything most people will ever experience Some people are turned off from this book because they're led to believe it is 'just another cancer story' Well I'm telling you that this is not just another cancer story it's so much more than just a cancer story It is definitely written for a young adult audience but I highly recommend it for adult readers as well All of John Green's novels have proven themselves to be through provoking and interesting and this one is by far my favorite If you purchase this book and enjoy it then I recommend all of his other novels
Of course it was perfect I can't have much to say that someone already didn't write but John made it worth the tears
I am speechless Truly and utterly speechless HOW COULD YOU DO THIS TO ME JOHN I don't even know what to do now OMG
Another sad story by John Green but definitely a great story with very lovable characters Sometimes life is just sad
This was such an awe inspiring story that rips through your heart A definite great read that challenges your emotions
Loved it Heartbreakingtouching and reaching the universal feelings of love and loss in a way that is fresh and real
It's an unfinished work much like the book they were reading should we request more information as to when Hazel dies
Keep a box of Kleenex on deck because you'll need it A great read that puts everything into perspective Just read it
Makes you want to live in Hazel and Agustus' hearts forever Stayed up many late nights because I couldn't put it down
You won't regret the read  Emotions will flare  Love wins This story will make you feel like life is worth the ride
I drive A LOT &amp; always order books on CD to help pass the time this was one of my favorite books MUST Listen too
The story is excellent and it is extremely well written It was hard to put the book down Now I want to see the movie

Nice story Lean and fluid For young readers at most Didn't love it A little depressant Best thing is a short novel
I bought this book for my daughter to read on her Kindle  She loved the book and I love how easy it is to download it
The Fault in Our Stars takes you on a whirlwind  of emotions both good and sad I wished  the book would've never ended

I love this book It is difficult to read at times but worth it It is story about love and how captivating it can be
This book is so AMAZING I personally loved this book My rating is FIVE STARS I recommend this book for everyone
I thought by the movie trailer there was going to be some redeeming value in this storyline but I must have missed it
Not just another sad story about dying but a story about living your life well and without regrets Highly recommended
Overall the book was good but it doesn't seem as if the story ended; he did the same thing the author in his book did
Wonderfully written from the point of view of a teenage girl yet by the author who is a middle aged mannicely done
This was the best book I have ever read it's hard to read through all the tearsI loved it not enough stars to rate
Not just a book about Cancer A beautiful love story that is filled with laughter pain and intelligent conversation

This book was one of the best meaningful books I have ever read and I'm going to read it over again and again and again

Captured the thoughts worries and humor of the human experience Well written I can't wait to read more of his work
even though the ending was as expected it was a very good readloved how the author got this young couple together
I think that there are about a million other people who would agree with me on this: this book was INCREDIBLE If you're questioning whether it's really as good as everyone keeps saying IT IS Trust me I was a bit wary to waste my time reading a book that seemed to be overrated but my friends convinced me to give it a shot and it was worth it It's not even the storyline itself that was unbelievably amazing but more of John Green's writing skills Everything is so well-worded and eloquently written Overall it's a must-readObviously it's a sad book but it's not overbearingly angsty so don't worry about that too much
This book opened my eyes about kids with cancer I never wanted to think about it before but this book insists These characters are perfecly created in the author's mind and then presented to the rest of us as a gift so we can also empathize with their view their parent's viewpoints their friends (some didn't support or stick with them as they'd promised) and their disappointments John Green has an compassion for these sick kids with a short life expectance and he knows how to write about it so his readers can gain the most from their story I'm going to read everything John Green has written He is a unique Young Adult author
Loved the personalities &amp; wit of the two main characters Time to watch the movie now  This book made me laugh &amp; cry
Holy moly that was a good book Just finished it and I'd recommend it to everybody Awesome book No questions needed
It was very sad and I hate to think about death but the love they shared was amazing I wish they would have both lived

Very good read I laughed cried was angry that there wasn't a happily ever afterloved it I recommend to anyone
I came to love the characters I cried and laughed but I think one reading is enough sad thoughts for quite a while
I hated every second of reading this overrated book writen by a pseudo-intellectual it's writen as if a 5th grader wrote it grammar mistakes are everywhere The characters had no depth I wasn't even sad when it ended because you don't care about these characters It's very formulaic - if you've ever read a John green novel then you already know what's going to happen I feel like people only like this novel because it's John green and they somehow believe they are smarter or better for reading his books Come on people It's a facade This is not literature - this is entertainment And it's poor entertainment at that
I read this book since it was a book club pick Maybe if I was 16 I'd really love this book but I'm notfar from it The story that interested me was Peter Van Houten I was so so tired of Augustus--an unrealistic teen And Hazel was nearly as annoying You knew this was going to be a tearjerker with the formula of teens and cancerso I felt manipulated from the start At least I can speed readso the pain of enduring this book was over quickly One star means I hate it And since it has a line or two that was somewhat worthy I had to say I didn't like it and be fair with two stars But 1 1/2 would be more honest
Sorry John Green fans but I think he's an absolute moron His writing was fine and the book was pretty decent He said some pretty stupid sexist things in his narrative Always find it odd to be reading a narrative of a teenage girl written by a middle aged man But maybe that's just me
I can't number enough stars to rate this book But since I'm a math fan and a one day becoming engineer I have to find a way to represent how much I loved this book how much this book moved meTherefore I'll pick: 9 That 9 can stand for stars or any other symbol you find proper Why 9 you think Simply because Hazel chose it when she could have chosen 10Thank you John Green for being able to place a smile in the middle of a sob*SPOILER ALERT*PS: I was so afraid you would become a Van Houten that I'd kept praying for the book to have an end So thank you for not becoming him
This book is beautiful and sad but the important difference is it's not beautiful because it is sad This book is also realistic in dealing with life and death in a scientific sense hopeful in demonstrating a humans will to live even in a world full of suck funny wry and tragicIt's full awesomeness is hard to describe The language is amazing it flows nicely the plot is fun and heartwrenching  (This is NOT a downer book It did make me sad to think about my own family if they had to go through what these kids did)And sorry John Green I cant help but picture Hazel as EstherPS I got a green J-Scribble
I love the book and you should read it it is cool and I mean it is awesome I love it üòÉüòÜüòÄüòÅüòÑüòÖüòÇüòéüò∏üòπ you posted

Oh my goodness What a sweet story of true young love Beautifully written The last several chapter had me bawling
It's so beautiful and yet so deep and thoughtful at the same time It is Amazing It is by far my favorite book
Makes you think A very different perspective on life and people  This book leads you where you never expect to go
Wonderful book really moved me A great read for any age whatever genre you may be used to I couldn't put it down
Interestingly enough it captured my attention right away I was submerged in the life within the death of this story
One of the best books I've ever read Even if you've seen the movie you must read the book as well (more detailed)
I loved the book really draws you in and gives you something really loved it  Read it over and over again
I loved it it was perfect it was filled with romance and death but the best was the love between two cancer patients
I'm crying this was just so cute it is 1:30 AM I refused to sleep till I finished it and I do not regret that choice

This book was fantastic I couldn't put it down it is very well written and one I will add to my permanent library
Quick and easy read  Fantastic for all ages  I am thrilled they made it a book  I bought a hard copy  Thumbs up
Although this book was good I think I was expecting more It is a good read it was just lacking some impact for me
This was a good story but I was a little disappointed  After all the attention the movie received I expected more
At any age or state of victimization of life one can only hope to be as insightful and brilliant as this character
Heartbreaking is the best way to sum up this book Loved the love story &amp; the sadness that's really truly heartfelt
honestly one of the best books ive ever read amazing use of words great job john green - another amazing novel :)

Sad and it lacking something It was a nice which read though Thank you John Green Your characters were wonderful
It was like a rollercoaster and you never knew when it was going to slow down or go up it was very emotional for me
I give this book 5 stars not only because it's good but to think people could actually relate to this it's amazing
Very very goodmy grand daughter recommended itso I read it before I watched the movie versionhard to put it down
Sad story but written pretty well there are definitely parts where you see the true genius of John Green's writing

Great witty prose  A few quirky/odd moments and characters which take me down to 4 stars rather than 5  Very sad
I enjoyed this book - whilst the topic was sombre harrowing even the writing and sub plot was well worth the read
LiterallyI love John Green books to begin with but I think perhaps this is his best work to date It was wonderful to step out of the guys' shoes and read a book narrated by a girl this time around It was wonderful to fall in love through her eyes with someone as absolutely amazing and enduringly intelligent and charismatic as Augustus WatersI laughedI criedI snortedI let out an uncontrollable laugh every time I read the Literal Heart of Jesus and I absolutely loved the intricate yet understandable verbatim of the charactersI will recommend this book for ever and for always
I cannot even begin to explain the pure awesomeness of this book It tore my heart into itty bitty bits but I enjoyed the process of reading it more then I like playing ukulele (and that's really saying something) I like this book more then I like Doctor Who And I REALLY REALLY REALLY like Doctor Who So yes it's technically a book about cancer But it's also a book about infinity a book about infinitely many things In fact that's one of the biggest infinities I know about Linguistically the narrative is amazing Easy to follow and with more and more depth every time you read it bursting with capital M Moments
Amazingly well-written intelligent funny and heartbreaking  I couldn't put it down  It's a definite must read
Great condition came without any bends or tears Near if not perfect cover and page quality In short great product
Awesome book I had seen the movie first and the book followed the movie very well  Would recommend it to anyone
This book was a very good book I just wish it had a different ending Cancer touches everyone in one way or another
I feel like this was written well knew it would end the way it did but was still sad to see it end the way it did
Made me cry for HOURSYou need a pack of tissues for this bookThe story is tragic and simply wonderful
Could not put it down  Left me aching inside because the conclusion was inevitable Will think of this for days
Hope the movie is just as good Glad I read it before Cancer is terrible Such a great book on young love and loss

I Enjoyed this book It is a sweet and moving tale I cried and laughed throughout the book which was a good thing
I'm so glad I read this  But I also wish I hadn't It's heartbreaking And I can't believe it ended just like AIA

Great read now I want to see movie to see what one is better It is usually the book reason for reading book first
I didn't particularly care for it but it did give a unique perspective on what it must be like to be terminally ill
Something about the way the book is written didn't make me emotional connected to the very sad moments of the book
Really enjoyed this novel A well written book a good read for any age not just teenagers could not put it down

this book was just flawlessnot many books make me cry but this one did not only sad tears but happy tears

Very real feelings I felt at times I was re living the loss of my husband to sarcoma of all things  just like Gus
honestly I was crying john green you are perfection I never thought I could read a book this amazing best book ever
A beautiful story of a boy and girl in love 10/10 a amazing story would definitely reccomend One of my favorites
This was a great book that has taught me and caused me to think deeper but shallower I highly recommend this book
This book was so good and I didn't want to stop reading it but it was kind of depressing I'd recommend it though
An amazing book about hope love and battling cancer And the two main characters have such a sweet relationship :)
I read this to see what all the hype was aboutand it was okayI read it straight through in one sitting so the plot was interesting and well paced However the dialogue was unrealistic and more than a little pretentious It wasn't as bad a the Nick&amp;Norah/Dash&amp;Lily books but pretty close Kids don't talk like that Not to say teenagers aren't intelligent or that they can't have real conversation but they don't speak in the long all-too-perfect monologues that littered this bookBottom line: IN MY OPINION it was worth reading and I liked it but it wasn't anything special
When I first started reading this book I thought that it was going to be about two people who fall in love with each other and stay together for a long time  living happily and all that (because to be honest I'm kind of a sucker for those types of stories) However after finishing it I'm glad do say that it didn't have a general fairy tale like ending Rather it was like a slap in the face-- the good kind that makes you realize things that you would have been blind to before This book is heartbreakingly beautiful and is definitely worth reading --at least once if not many many  many more times than that
I'm not gonna write a summary there are already well over 1000 reviews so I'll just keep it simple This book did things to me I never imagined a book could do  I felt everything  Every emotion  Every pain  Everything  I loved this book  Don't bother with tissues  Just go straight for the paper towel  The whole roll  You will laugh and you will cryhard  Do not pass this book up  It will stay with you long after you read it  Just make sure you have a chaser book to follow it with something funny  It will be the only way to salavage whatever is left of your heart  John Green you are AMAZING
I consider myself something of an avid reader and few novels have done to me what this one did I am a 26 year old male A Civil Engineer in the state of Texas and was raised in the state of Mississippi in the exact manner you might suspect While I show my emotions more than most of those who live around me it is still somewhat of an oddity for something like a book to elicit anything more significant that a Wow what a good book when I'm done John Greenyou have written a fantastic novel that reaches any reader who picks it up I would recommend this book to anyone I come across (and have) A MUST read
I loved the way this book was written One minute I would be laughing out loud and the next I would be teary eyed
I'm an adult reader and I love this book It was an easy and fast read I especially loved the character Augustus
Beautiful personal inspiringThis book is relatable to us all and is one that will be read and re-read and
Good read for anyone and everyone Not relatable to many yet I'm sure touching for all And perk - well written
A must read So intelligent whimsical You fall in love with the characters as they fall in love for one another
I loved this book It has a way of making you feel blessed loved thankful and optimistic all wrapped up in one
There was so much hype I decided to read it but I didn't like it; but I'm not much of a young adult genre reader
I loved everything about this book irlt was amazing definitely recommend for anyone who loves love stories
Sweet and romantic I love it I consider the book for the middle school crowdBest book I have read so far

I loved this book It is an unexpected love story and love stories usually do not engage mehowever this one did
I hope you like contemplating death and young love Hating the Dutch helps too Now I guess I should see the movie

This book is simiply amazing Very well written and such a good read Strongly recommend it for people of any age
It had a little risk in the cover but nothing really big I keep it cuz it was so minimal Other then that great
Took me a while to get  the nerve to start but finished after three nights and in the middle of a Master's class
I am the mother of a childhood cancer survivor and I loved this story I've read it twice and love the characters
this book gave me a new perspective on life and death  everyone handles it their own way but love transcends all
Good easy quick read A book you don't want to set down You could predict the ending but still worth the read
I had to read the book before seeing the movie It was funny and sad and amazing Can't wait to get the movie now
This story is smart and funny and heartbreaking Well written for both my 12-year-old and for me at the same time
One of the best YA books ever written but also enjoyable for adults  Be prepared to feel again in literature

This was my first Kindle bookThe story was realistic and the characters believe able  I enjoyed the book

Couldn't put it down now to watch the movie Well written and easily understandable  I will be reading more books
I got tired if round adult but hazel's voice was a pleasant surprise and I really enjoyed it Would recommend it

The Fault In Our Stars by John Green tells the story of a young teen girl who has Cancer  At her weekly Cancer support group session that she is reluctant to go to she meets a young teen boy who takes a special interest in her  I don't think I'm giving up too much if I tell you that a romance developsThis book lives up to all the hype in my opinion  I flat out LOVED IT  It is a beautiful love story that I was into from page one to the end  If this story doesn't tear at your heart strings then I don't know what will  I'm not ashamed to admit that I cried  Please give this book a chance
The language he uses to describe the situation is appropriate and often exquisite An easy and fast book to read
Such a sad story; but beautifully written  It tells a love story of two teenagers living with serious illnesses

Crazy great ending This was probably the greatest book written in the 2000s I'm in love with this book üòä
Finding meaning within a life that seems to take away the very things that have the most meaning look within
Easy read and I hate to be this guy but the last third of the book was very predictable Moderately entertaining

LOVED EVERY CHAPTER Get ready to cry This book will punch you right in the feels Looking forward to the movie
I enjoyed this book because of the love between the kids A dark subject though Cancer is a tough subject
Intelligent witty and easy to read I recommend this to anyone looking to laugh and cry or cry while laughing
Too much like a Jodi Picoult novel Took me ages to get into it but read it because I had nothing else to read
My 19yr old daughter has the same cancer and my heart goes out to both families  Take time to smell the flowers
This is a good story about 2 young lovers battling cancer  It just fell a little short of my exceptions though
Well written good story Not what one would expect from a teen novelthough my teen who recommended it loved it
Awesome so sweet and sad I've never read anything like it U should read it Favorite book by far  Abby
I read the book so I could watch the movie It was so good I am now afraid that the movie will be disappointing
Just perfect John Green did a fabulous job on this book like I just said so sad but yet great at the same time
I liked it good story seemed mostly realistic  Some of it was a bit overly mature for the teenage characters
I had to makes this as its ok because well okay okay but I honestly thought that this book was a bit over rated
This is a moving novel about the human spirit a very compassionate young man and coping  I would recommend it
I liked the book  It was a good love story  It had a sad ending but the plot was good and kept me interested
Loved the way the author expressed emotionsbut it also lost the plot a little were the Anne book was concerned
Such a beautiful story I laughed and obviously cried I am still crying  Life is precious Gus and Hazel xoxox
Amazing Great read I couldn't put it down Sad touching and really spoke to me Don't miss reading this book
This is a younger read than I had anticipated  Nice story all in all I would recommend it to a teenager
Very beautifully written Will read again as it was hard to put down Let's hope the movie can meet it's match
This was a beautiful book I loved it so much John Green you are a great author This is my new favorite book
So lovely and heart warming I cried laughed and had a few smiles with this book I would recommend to anyone
I couldn't put this book down  So beautifully sad yet it leaves you feeling inspired to be the best you can be
Very touching story Not like anything else I've read I loved it Sad but wonderful at the same time Great book
I have read this book 3 times now I love every bit of it I TOTALY recommend this book to all genders and ages
I didn't know what to think when I first started readingbut then I couldn't put it down I love this book ‚ù§Ô∏è
I read only while my son was sleeping and still finished in less than 36 hours because it was hard to put down
This is a Great story about how young people deal with cancer  highly recommend this book for all ages to read
Amazing book Finished in one sitting and sobbed when it was over  A book worth having your heart broken over
I loved it I went back to my youth I shared w my own teenaged daughter and I NOTICED the world once more üëçüëè
Reading it for the second time in 2 months It's a great book that will make you smile and cry at the same time
When did teens having cancer become funny  When reading this book  Sharp humour  Light on the pathos  A gem
This is so heartfelt and beautiful A wonderful story with a half tragic ending But it beautiful none the less
The movie was so beautifully done that I look forward to the book It is about love pure and innocent and good
This book is happy at the beginning and sad in the middle and end its really good and I wish it would never end
While the subject is a bit morbid--teens facing cancer--the characters are so endearing that it makes up for it
Best book ever it is really touching and bittersweet It makes me feel mixed emotions when Gus died Read this
The best worst book I've read Read it Makes you realize how fragile life and love is One of my new faverites
This is one of my faves never cried so hard reading a book Well wrote and executed Will recommend to all
Thank you John Green for blessing the world with your book The Fault in Our Stars It is truly a gift my friend
about true love and lost and gain and moving on I will make you crySome Infiniti are bigger than others
One of my favorite books yet One I couldn't put down Definitely recommending to all of my book loving friends

I thought it would be written for teens; but this Grandma loved it My 14 year old granddaughter recommended it
Hi  I enjoyed the book a lot  I thought the author had an amazing amount of insight  Great book for all ages

Nice Read Well written More suited to a young adult audience I enjoyed it although I am a more mature reader
Loved the characters in this book Very easy read I cried a lot but others in my book club did not cry as much
I guess I should have expected a story about young cancer patients to be depressing but this was such a downer
Touching andb perfect for fiction unique and one the best books I have ever read in my life Highly recommended
This was a so so book I was really excited about starting it but the literary quality wasn't what I thought it would be Also all of the existentialism was trying to be more intellectual than it really was I found the conversations between Augustus and Hazel to be a little pretentiousNevertheless it was a really easy read and I finished it in a day I would recommend it to young adults who want to read a love story that doesn't really have a lot of emotional or literary depth But if you are looking for an engaging or exciting novel this is not the one I would recommend
This book was just plain amazing Everything was in it: sadness humor (I laughed out loud at some parts) soul and romance I personally do not like sob stories that is before I read this book I don't know what quality made it so but this changed my perspective on sad stories I would recommend this to anyone in a heartbeat especially if that someone was looking for something to feed the soul and teach about life This book also has an abnormal abundance of quote-worthy phrases I wrote down a few just so that I would remember them for a long time I learned so much about life from this book
As the mother of a 16-year-old teen I felt fortunate that my daughter recommended I read this book after she finished it  I loved it as both a shared experience with my daughter but also the chance to discuss difficult life challenges and sorrows with her We are both serious Nerd-Fighters and fans of John Green books  We recommend them ALLJohn Green is an amazing writer who really understands how difficult growing from a kid into a teen and finally toward adulthood can be today for our young peopleI recommend this to every parent of a teen to share with their teen
This was a an amazing read I bought it on sale not knowing what it was about but it turned out to be worth it
Just a good book to read You will have your own opinions through this book so it is good for food for thought
Love it but it's a little boring when you saw the movie &amp; now reading the book like it's just like the movie
There's so much truth in this novel- the wisdom and knowledge they have is apart hard to bear One of the best
Great book Looing forward to seeing the movie but afraid it will disappoint since I liked the book sooo much
Darling love story  Sad that they were sick but so nice they found each other &amp; loved each other before dying
Good book  Written well and moves along at a quick pace  You'll be done before you know it and read it again
LOVED IT Gonna re-read and re-read over and over again Little sad but really well written with so much depth
A beautiful story that I couldn't put down I sped through this book It really had me hooked Highly recommend
I liked just about everything about it and cried at the end It was such a good book and I'll never forget it
Great book Totally heart touching I would read this book again Way better than the movie But most books are
This book was amazing but at the end I screamed so many unanswered questions But it was such an amazing book
Amazing book I cried all through the end but it was so worth it I'm planning on reading this book many times
Great book to read especially if you or someone you know has gone through similar issues mentioned in the book
Loved the book Read it in 2 days Watched the movie afterwards  Dialouge from movie very similar to the book
So heart warming and smart So funny yet sad - I really enjoyed this book and am sure I will read it soon again
This book is a super-quick read and will make you sob as much as the movie so be mindful of reading in public
This book was wonderful I couldn't put it down  The characters are rich and full and the story is beautiful
The Fault in Our Stars is a great book It's so inspirational I would recommend it for those who love to read
The best book ever Way better than I expected any book could ever be in the whole entire universe to this day
I absolutely love romance books I hardly ever read or cry I wish I could find true love like that someday
It was hard to explain to my husband why I was crying so he just nodded and told me is okay you'll be fine
Beautifully written I now can't wait to see the movie and compare the differences between the two I loved it
Great book Great story Great author Seems so real Will read more books from this author in the near future
This book was just absolutely amazing I plan on re-reading it later on Such a great love story and much more

Loved the entire book but felt a little let down by the ending One of the best books I've read in a long time
I chose this rating because this book is absolutely perfect From the way it was written to the very last page
Incredibly honest raw and heartfelt A true love story from an unlikely couple A page turner from the get go
So many thoughts and feelings yet an easy read  Wise beyond their years  Very we'll done and I'd recommend it
Loved this book A good read that makes you think about yourself and the ones you love Would highly reccomend
A definite read for all ages a girl with cancer looks at life like anyone else and you'll just really like it
My daughter loved this book so I decided to read it  I loved it too  Very sweet story and thought provoking
Consider this book and you will not put it down  trust me you will be near someone you think about all the time
A great book for teens and even adults who want a quick read Heads up though this book will make you tear up
Touching and sincere Love is raw and real It is not confined to gender age or cognitive ability it just is
I read this book very quickly but I wasn't a huge fan It's a cute romance story but mostly really depressing
Never understood what hurts so good meant till I finished this book Changed my whole life inspired me to love
This book is perfect This is my third time reading it because once I start I can't stop Read this book
I've never cried so hard about a book Ever Such great quotes however this book left me heartbroken Read it
This book is SO GOOD I love it so much- it is so poignant and yet also sharply funny and tragic and beautiful
Overall good book Entertaining but not awesome I wouldn't read it again but for the first read it was good
Read this each night before I went to bed Easy read with characters that you can definitely fall in love with
SPOILER ALERT My mother was having a hard time in buying me this book because she thought it would be a depressing novel though she couldn't be more wrong This book is filled with love Hazel and Augustus love for each other Hazals parents love for her and Augustus parents love for him The book is filled with so much meaning and when Augustus died all I could do was cry All I could think about was what Augustus said Oh I wouldn't mind Hazel Grace it would be a privilege to have my heart broken by you and thinking how ironic is it Amazing book that I would recommend to anyone
It's hard to say why The Fault in our Stars was so good Something about it grabbed me and I could not put it down The characters were so vivid and raw and real Hazel and Augustus and even Isaac will stay with me for a very long time Based on the subject matter it seems this book would be depressing but it's not In some very strange way it was uplifting and hopeful TFIOS is a beautiful picture of how two very real teenagers deal with adversity They don't sugarcoat anything They face life's uphill battles full on and we have a front row seat Highly highly recommend this little gem
because then I could read it all over again for the first timeI would go somewhere no one would find me and read it straight through from start to finish I would met the characters for the first time again be amazed at how they become so real they just about climb out of the book and into the room with you I would slow down and enjoy each word each hilarious touching smart turn of dialogue each perfectly-wrought description I would laugh and cry out loud (again) and remember that THIS -- being pulled in and under by a completely unforgettable story -- is why I love books
John Green invaded my life one week last month Searching for some captivating videos on you tube to show my high school social studies classes I stumbled on Green's brilliant Crash Course videos- he has basically become the Bill Nye of History That same week I stumbled upon John Green's books while browsing the Kindle store I saw the excellent reviews and decided to give it a go in spite of the seemingly depressing content matter Once I started I was engrossed You will be immersed and the world around you will fade away- exactly what a great novel is supposed to do Read it
This is by far my favorite John Green book Holy goodness The character development of Hazel and Agustus is absolutely perfect Even the addition of peripheral characters is fantastic Hazel and Agustus (and even Isaac) walk that fine line of being precocious and being silly teenagers who write smart aleck ads for dilapidated swing sets on a Craigslist sort of forum John Green has that magical ability to perfectly balance humor and tenderness This book is so perfectly hilarious and at the same time poignant I've never laughed or cried so much in one book Well done John DFTBA -Sarah
Interesting story with likeable characters  I had never read John Green before but now I'm definitely a fan
This was somewhat of a slow read for me Hard to get into but I still wanted to finish after seeing the movie
I would recommend this book to people of all ages It is a wonderful reminder of the brevity of life and love
Such a great read Such an easy read Would definitely recommend it Can't wait to read more John Green books
A whole lot of telling not enough showing However Green gets the voice right and that's worth a lot to me
This book is a great way to spend your free time From intense paragraphs to happy words you will be thrilled
Caught some of the movie and decided to start the book Glad I did Will watch the movie in its entirety now
Very enjoyable to read So emotional I laughed I cried I couldn't put it down I would recommend this book
5 is totally recommended for this bookI love this storyI would like it to make more books about it
This book was so good I couldn't put it down It was so sad and emotional but definitely one of my favorites

I just finished school and I wanted something to read Easy but yet intellectual Just what I was looking for
I read this book in 2 days That's how great it is I love it so Much This book is one of the best I've read
I like that John Green talks like this I have trouble appreciating teenagers who do That's just me I guess
This is the best book and a sad book at the same time Awesome is the only word that I can describe this book
I loved the book but you can definitely see the parts that were written for the teen crowd  Good read though

The Fault in our stars is a good book definitely aimed towards girls though I still really enjoyed the book
I thoroughly enjoyed this read  It's well written and the prose is clear and direct  It was worth the price

Awesome book Highly recommendedI read it during my husband's chemo treatments The book spoke volumes
I cried I laughed I went through boxes of tissues This book is seriously amazing Like buy it Okay Okay
It was sad and depressing even though it was a love story the part about the auther was a little far fetched
Beautifully written and thought provoking Portrays a side of cancer that isn't often written or talked about
Laughing and crying at the same time  beautifully written story that was deep and heart felt  Glad I read it
The story is hard but it is very well written and we laugh and cry Life is not fair but I enjoyed this book
Green fans will be captivated by this wonderful story He gets in the head of a teen better than anyone ever
sad but interesting read  Young people with a fatal disease is never a happy topic but I liked the treatment
Good read Needed more closure (a purely preferential want) Otherwise no complaints It had me until the end
No one comes into this world with an expiration date stamped on there heal  Life is to short to be miserable
I wish the book told a story about what happens next Like hazel I'm a little upset I do not know he ending
I liked it a lot It's inspiring and beautifully written I couldn't put the book down I recommend this book

Beautiful book and so touching Shows the side of cancer most people chose to ignore The harsh reality of it
A deep insight to how to view life A good read with valuable lessons A plot within a plot-interesting views
There is some heavy duty content in this book but it is so beautifully written that it makes it a great read
I couldn't stop laughing and crying at the same time This book really makes you FEEL  Loved it Wanted more
the best book I have ever read made me cry but it is still an amazing book and I would recommend it to anyone
This book was amazing in ever way It was so perfect:) in every wayBut beware you will cryA lot
The raw pain and anguish combined with the simple beauty found in young love left me wanting for more pages

Read it It says I need to write more words in order to submit this review but I don't know what else to say
I loved it it was amazing and heart felt you cried and laughed it was an awesome book everybody should read it
This book is such a piece of art I'm left without words it's just perfect This book marked me on such a way
I am literally crying as I write this review Beautiful Perfect I could not put it down Read this book now
GREAT book cried almost all the way through it but it was so worth it such an inspirational book loved it
One of the best books I've read in a long timePerhaps the best love story I've ever heardREAD IT
These reviews are pointless I cried for the last 100 pages abouts and am still crying That about sums it up
I tried restraining myself from crying so hard that I actually hurt my chest and throat doing so Must read
Great book and amazing read but just a warning this book made me cryAwesome love story that really is sometin
First book I've read on my kindle and I snottted all over it So many many tears Heart-crushingly great read
Made me cry it was just that good I can't wait to read another of John greens booksI hope u enjoy it
This read is one that will stay with you and make you remember that first love again but only the good parts
Just the most perfect book I can't describe I hope this book is able to be enjoyed by everyone with a soul
This book was an amazing story It listed under Young Adult but I think it is really a story for all the ages
All age groups can relate to this great book that will bring you to tears multiple times throughout the story
Wow this book had me balling my eyes out I fell in love I never wanted it to end John green is amazing
this book is the best book ever written and I recommend it to everyone :))) like seriously read it right now
Very good book at some points I felt it was a little dry but very well written I would definitely recommend
This book made me happy and then sad and then I would cry but it's still one of the best books I've ever read
Lived up to the hype Excited for the film John Green is wonderful Will for sure read the rest of his works
My students were very engaged and felt that this is one of the books that they would remember for a long time
The best book I have read in a long time I loved every single minute of it John Greene is extremely talented
I loved this book It's like I was there with the characters and I felt what they felt Great job John Green
This book was Amazing Words can not describe how good this book was I would for sure recommended this book
It's a good book and extremely thought provoking I didn't imagine I would get so sad or become so attached
I love this book (: I almost cried at the end :`( it had such a inspirational ending and I just love this book
very nicely done a good book even if it is a very hard subjectI recomend it but everybody will like it
It is great; not perfect but great A lot of authors make the mistake of thinking their stories are worth so many pages than they are They draw out plots that are barely there and focus on characters you don't care about I might argue Green did the opposite; not by much it's walking a fine line of course But I for one would have appreciated developing Augustus and Hazel more as well as giving more breadth to their relationship All in all I'd say when your biggest criticism about a book is simply that there isn't more of it it's accomplishing the only task it's meant to serve
Honestly this is a must read book for everyone I totally loved it I laughed and I cried the last chapters of the book and at the end was just speechless It teaches you about life and love and how to appreciate yourself if you are well and healthy Makes you cherish your life even more and also it makes you realize how unfair life really is sometimes I loved the characters and their funny remarks and how they made a joke of their sickness and not pity themselves Wish the book AIA that they mentioned actually existed so that I could read it and love it as much as Hazel and Gus did
The best read I've had in recent memory I would reread this every time PS: I have not yet watched the movie
Amazing book Couldn't put it downa love story never to be forgotten with such a touching look on life 
Loved this book  Taught me some lessons on being Human and that maybe the dying have a better take on it
Wonderful book  Inspirational and beautifully written  Just make sure to have a box of tissues next to you
It was good but the hype is way too built up The dialogues are nice I guess but it didn't do anything to me
The book was very touching and opened my eyes to new things  My daughter who is 14 talked me into reading it
This is an amazing book It pulled me in from the first sentence I'm going to read more John Green books
Really good book It deserve five stars I had a hard time putting this really good book down Two thumbs up
This book is breathtaking It is beyond words Thank you John Green Thank youThis is to much Wow :)
Made me think and compare and feel  It is like Sun smiling  through foggy places  The end is the beginning

Kept my interest through to the end of the book Definitely helped me to look at cancer in a different light

A true insight to how people feel who actually have cancer in different stages Wanted more story by the end

Fast read since I could not put it down  Definitely need a box of tissue close by  Very moving and humbling
It was an amazing and very inspirational novel that made me laugh and cryI loved it Good work John Green

I think this is an amazing book Keeps you laughing with sarcastic humor and keeps you crying The best kind
I enjoyed the book immensely It wasn't a tear jerker for me but was a realistic look at disease and family
The characters are amazing - I am still thinking about them a week later and wish I could have know them more
This book brought tears to my eyes It was a romantic book perfect for young adults All I need to say is wow
I lost my sister to cancer when she was 19 This reminded me of her in a nostalgic way A cute romance story

The Fault in Our Stars has an intriguing plot and reminds one of how short and sometimes unfair life can be
wow it is sad story but it is written so well that you feel good for Hazel i enjoyed reading it 4 stars
I liked the book but found it a sad read The plot was interesting but you will need a box of tissues handy
As a cancer survivor myself this book was depressing It had some good moments but was all too real for me
I was highly disappointing with this book series for many reasons1 despite the entire theme of the book it still turned in to another cliche teen drama romance2 Honestly the book is overrated though written well there is absolutely nothing special about this3 He overplays his hand with the cancer theme If he were to be a little more subtle about the cancer than it might have had a stronger voice but unfortunately I felt like the book was only about the cancerDon't get me wrong I love John Green's books but this one not a good one
Great story that I could not put down Read this instead of seeing the movie You will not be disappointed
My granddaughter asked me to read this book  She was correct very well written sad funny and inspiring
I enjoyed the book Really enjoyed getting to know the characters John Green does a nice job in this book
Pretty easy read Some parts drug out in the middle towards the end but overall good read and nice ending
Good book Really liked it You don't really get sad til the ending The girl is terminal but the boy dies
Not as sad as I expected The book is hard to put downCancer is not an easy subject to write about 
This was so romantic I saw the movie and have finally read the book It brought me to tears Just amazing
I can't and won't stop crying I don't [ever] read romantic novels but this isn't your typical love story
No teenagers speak like that Maybe in the movies and TV but real life No Other than that it's alright
This book was recommended to me by my 15 yr old son  That should say it all since he doesn't like to read
I loved loved loved this book Definitely a must read I didn't ever put it down Keep those tissues handy
I loved the movie and the bookit is so good I wanted to cry and the first time I watched the movie I cried

When a young people know they only have a few days in life how they will feel and reactThank you John
Despite a doubtless depressing topic this novel is beautifully and cleverly written Difficult to put down

This book was really touching and sad The main reason why I read it was so I could watch the movie though
An amazing coming of age story for teen readers  Really showed that teens are very adult in so many ways
Very interesting good characters  Different outlook on cancer  Would recommend Have not seen the movie
I know that at my age of 73 I have yesteryear ahead than behind I only hope my view is as clear as Hazel's
Read this book in less than a day  Made me cry but also laugh  Can't wait to read more of author's books

this book gave me the good kind of chills that you look for in every book John green has a way with words
the best book I have ever read and I have read a lot of books this is my 6th time reading it and I love it
heartfelt read it now not even half way through but I'm already in love with it can't wait to finish it
this is the type of book where you want to meet people like Augustus and Hazel and just hang out with them
My daughter loves this author and read this book in record time  She is 13 so she found it very enjoyable
A story of death &amp; dying told in an honest and direct way without being maudlin  A fast and touching read
Could not put the book down you will not be sorry  John green captures the reader from the very first page
ive never cried so much this book made me question what i want to do with my life definitely a must-read
I really don't get emotional over books but this one gets me literally every time John Green is a genius
enjoyed this book very much  it would make a great movie  I hope everyone who needs hope reads this book
I was hooked the moment I started Very touching and well written A very good read I highly recommend it
Easy read I finished it in one day Makes you think twice about your life I'd recommend this for any age
This book has the ability to make you realize how lucky you are and how important it is to value your time
This was such a great book I read it in two days I wanted to see what would happen to the main characters
This book is a great easy read Well written It has a great story line that feels very real-great fiction
Though it deals with a difficult subject it felt like a privilege to get a glimpse into Hazel and Gus' relationship For the reader it was a short time but for the 2 main characters it was and always will be infinite John Green said in one of his vlogbrother videos All I could think about as night fell was how much you could love made-up people and how much you can miss them This is how I feel about the two main characters As I think back to write this review it's impressive that in a relatively short novel I could feel that I knew someone well and lost them
Perhaps I am just too old to have read and appreciated this book but I felt it was totally overrated  What could have been a really sweet but tragic love story was wasted on a subplot about a book they both liked and meeting the author of said book  They were together a handful of times and the author provided no chemistry between the two characters until it was too late  They hardly formed even a solid friendship anywhere in the pages  The relationship was totally underwhelming It was OK but I totally do not understand the hype that has surrounded this book
This book is one of my favorite books that I have read so far It made me laugh and cry and when I finally finished it I was extremely satisfied with how it ended It is a sad book but it is also very realistic It's about two kids with cancer trying to deal with their diagnoses and still be teenagers Obviously when you have cancer not everything ends happily which is one of the main reasons why I love this book It is an accurate portrayal of kids with cancer and it is very realistic Overall an amazing read everyone should own and read a copy of this book
THE FAULT IN OUR STARSReview by Tess (Books On Board)The Fault in our Stars is a book about living It is about all that is life: Love laughter heartache friendship beauty fear loss death illness adversity This book doesn't manipulate your emotions as most do but it brings tears to your eyes out of sheer knowledge and the registering in your brain of the beauty or ugliness for that matter Of every day living Open your eyes to reality and its possibilities I would highly recommend this to anyone who wants to see and be enlightened
Wow its great this is a great book its so exiciting and is full of wonderfull characters and wow thank you

I can't stop crying  I really can't stop It's so amazing and so perfect I love John green I really do
Great book from start to finish It made me laugh  cry and  smile John Green is an extraordinary writer
John Green has done a splendid job spinning a world that you just want to crawl into  I was delighted to find that this novel targeted for a young adult audience had so much to offer in thought provoking content  This book engages the reader in a mature conversation about important topics  Once I started I found myself melting through pages as I voraciously devoured the deliciously stimulating plot  This book is a shining example of a genuine hand crafted novel piquing your interest at every turn  Enrapturing to the very end this book is well worth the read
This book was not what I was expecting but I LOVED it  It was so well written and it was laugh-out loud funny at times in spite of the fact one of the underlying themes is deathI fell in love with the characters immediately it was impossible not to  Their deep philosophical thinking and no-holds barred honesty was liberating; at times their thoughts were astounding because of their ages but in light of their experiences completely understandableI look forward to reading other stories by John Green and highly recommend this book :)
omgit came yesterday and was finished being read yesterday this book is truely amazing and well there is nothing i can really say without giving spoilers everyone said it would make you laugh and cryi actually didjohn really did write the most epic book in historyit is my An Imperial Aflictionalthough i did find 1 typo and a place where there ahould have beena spaceit did not bring down its reread points or gloryi will cherish my preorderedsigned copy forevernever tobe put in a yard sale or donated to goodwill or salvation armyokay
A great young adult book well written and refreshing despite the dark subject matter Thought provoking
Great book Full of laughter and tears Saw the movie first and couldn't wait to read the book after ward
It is not a cancer book  It is a book about death and love it is a book about life too and it is amazing
Mo loved it It really hit home for me and I would definitely recommend it to anyone and everyone Enjoy
It was really kind of boring for an adult I can see that it could be poignant for a  young adult reader
I thought it was a Good book since my cousin just got over cancer about a month ago It's just so AMAZING
This was a great books I love the love story in it I will read it a billion times because it was so good
This book was amazing It was heartwarming but it was also a little sad in parts So sad it is over üò≠
Loved the book and the movie I had times where I laughed and cried Equally heart-breaking and touching
I thought this was a good book It was flowery in language but the sentiments were honest and insightful
Uniquely written story with an alternative view of facing life's tragedies  Highly recommend this one
This story gives hope but shows love an the meaning behind It is your life to live live it as you wish
This is one of the sweetest funniest saddest books you will ever read about three terminally ill teens
One of the best books I've read Could not stop reading it until I was done and then was sad it was over
Heartbreaking and unsentimental simultaneously Not light reading but well written and worth the trouble
Funny and sad at the same time I laughed and cried cussed and cheered This book left me pondering life
This book is flawless and I cried And I never cry in books And it was definitely better than the movie
Read by Pam Becker  enjoyed the book quite a bit  Didn't see the movie  Unusual quirky characters
I have not seen the movie or read the book but my girlfriend was all about it and really liked the book
What a great read with an honest view of love family and raw feelings of devastating illness and death
I really really like what this book sounds like depending on what my other friends have told me about it
This book was a great read it's sad but it gets you to thinking about life I will recommend to others
I dident like the ending becouse of how I dent get to see how I reacted-hazel grace In memory
A book that I finish in 24 hours deserves 4 stars Even though it was predictable I couldn't put it down
You don't get to pick your life It takes many avenues  You just have  to live every day to its best
I was very disappointed in the ending I thought Gus Waters had written the ending of the book for Hazel
I was extremely surprised I got a signed copy by the author I was an alzome book Well taken care off
I know this was a popular book but it's just not for a pragmatist such as myself I couldn't get into it
One of the best books I ever read Can't wait to watch the movie I'm so gonna cry when I watch the movie
While the book is worth reading be prepared to keep tissues close at hand as you draw closer to the end
The book was really amazing i never thought it would be but at I got more into it became more interesting
I love this book so much It is a sad book but it has a good topic behind it I recommend it to everyone

this book is a great book although it didn't make me cry or anything i recommend this book to everyone
sad story that allows you to reflect on your own mortality and what do you want to leave in this world
It was a very good book IT IS SO FAR THE BEST BOOK I HAVE EVER READ I really enjoyed reading this book
This book was completely beautiful  It could not be more aptly described than by the quote on its cover that is filled with staccato bursts of humor and tragedyThe Fault in Our Stars is both painful and funny all while exploring themes of infinity oblivion humanity and our collective reaction to the universe and our own consciousness  Green writes in such a captivating and intelligent way as to make the book and its dense themes relatable but not patronizing for its target audienceIf you read this book you will most certainly love it
‚ù§Ô∏è John Green
A difficult yet eye-opening realization for anyone not directly impacted by someone dealing with cancer or any other terminal illness  Not sold on whether these are really accurate thoughts and perceptions of a teenager even in lieu of the terminal diagnosis  However this is a fictional story intended for a young adult reader and therefore perfectly written to take them to a sort of idealistic portrayal of young love accompanied with the ugly realism of cancer and terminal illness  Well written and no lack of intensity to keep the reader attentive
In what has been a record setting year for me in terms of total books read there have been a couple of real stand outs The Fault In Our Stars by John Green is not only one of the best of this year's books it is now on my list of all time favorites The story is about two kids that meet in a cancer support group I don't want to say much more because I wouldn't want to wreck a second of it for anyone who is interested in reading it It's sad it's funny very thought provoking and the dialogue is top notch If you need something to read give it a try
A lot of emotions weird thoughts by younger kids and choices made to found love All of it is just nice
Great book The ending was unexpected but you really connected with the characters I enjoyed this book
One of the most amazing touching inspirational and emotional stories that I have read I looooooved it
This is by far the best book I have read It is a book I recommend to everyone It is profoundly moving
Nice and touching book better than the movie and with a lesson of life that we should have to consider
This book wrecked me Be sure you're alone when you read it or it will make you cry in front of people
I ugly cried  Like snot running down my nose I need a towel not a tissue ugly cried  It was awesome
The Fault in our Stars is a well crafted amazingly honest book It made me chuckle and it made me cry
I really enjoyed this book was and was an easy read Definitely was a tear jerker towards the end of it
I love this book I have seen the movie and I cries during both This book shows what love and death is
I re read this book for the third time this year and I still love it Keep up the great work John Green
Loved this book from first to last word I will read it again and again Everyone should love like this
I think Gus did the right thing Rip Gus waters I would of Fallon in love to They're love was special

Tear jerker A beautiful read full of amazing quotes It is a quick read and very much worth your time
Best book I have ever read You need to read it NOW It is super interesting meanwhile it is depressing
I recommend this book to anyone who likes to read  I loved John Green writing and this is a amazing book
Because it is better then any book I have ever read and is well written I LOVE THE FAULT IN OUR STARS 
This was a book I could not put down It catches you right from the beginning all the way until the end
I loved this book It made me feel every emotion - sadness along with laughter Great book for all ages
It was the best book in the entire worldI thought it was just perfect and beautiful I fell in love
This was a good story Sad but sounds like it could be based on true happenings I liked the characters
This book is the only thing keeping me going keeping me truly alive That should be enough of a review
I love this book It's so heartfelt and sad one might cry so hard reading this so innocently by oneself
I wish there was like an epilogue or something on whether she died or not it's just like AIA in a way
With all the great reviews and emotions on Amazon  I was expecting so much more  it was ok  that's it
Good book Dialogue is a bit too snappy to seem realistic but you truly feel for both of the characters
I thoroughly enjoyed this book only took me 4 hours to read That alone says a lot Great book alltheway
It's a beautiful book with a very moving story You wannna cry the whole bookYou have to read it
It was a little predictable but it was an amazing book I couldn't put it down once I started Loved it
I thought that perhaps if I waited a few weeks I would have time to reflect on this book and be better prepared to write a review about it I was mistakenIt was fun while I read it but overall I did not find it to be a memorable book or one that I would want to discuss with friends The characters that I found to be most interesting were not the main characters (parents friend who lost his sight etc) The lead male was almost too perfect (great for a Dawnson's Creek-type storyline) with an ending that would make Nicholas Sparks jealous
Wow this book is simply a MUST READ From start to finish i was always attached to the book; it was just so alluring and made you want to read more The story of Hazel Grace Lancaster and her journey with Augustus Waters is simply just beautiful I like how this book just makes you think - like REALLY think about life death love and our place in this world Not gonna lie it made me bawl like a baby It gives you a new perspective on life and your loved onesI would certainly say that everybody - above the age of 13 - should read this book
It's been a day and it still hurts when trying to breathe around the thoughts consumed by this book How can fictional characters have such a huge life How can their trials and suffering become part of us Oh Hazel Grace Oh Augustus Waters Oh Isaac Such a universe of LOVE Such epic grandeur in wishes and dreams Were it possible that we could all be as brave and selfless as these marvelous heroes John Green you are undoubtedly a worldwide treasure and your talent knows no bounds My heart is steeped in both sorrow and joy and for this I thank you
The fault in our stars is an amazing story about hazel grace lancaster who meets the charming augustus waters at one of her group meetings Through the novel you see how their emotions and actions towards each other develop and change over time This is by far the best book I have ever had the pleasure of reading John green has the ability to depict such realistic characters and has more knowledge of what goes on in a teenage girls life than I do amd I ama a teenage girl but this book in my opinion should be considered a classic eventually Buy it 
I could not decide if I was to old to love this book the way I did As I read the book I thought to myself that I'm glad I stumbled upon it in my mid twenties and not mid-teens To laugh and cry at the exact time is truly a rare form of art that John Green  has gifted upon all of us in This Fault in Our Stars The characters are flawless their humor noteworthy but the connection you feel will become heart wrenching My recommendation is to sit down for a full 24 hours and fall in love with Hazel Grace and Augustus Waters all at once Truly delighted
I read the first paragraph of this book quoted on another site and had to find out what it was about After reading a sample I knew I had to buy this bookI finished reading it the day it came in the mail a few days ago I am in love with this book There was never a moment where I felt bored I hung on every word of every page It really pulls you in There's love humor tragedy It makes you laugh and cry but it also makes you think This is the first book from John Green that I've read but I'm definitely reading all his other works
I am a self proclaimed YA fiction junkie  That said I found this book resonated with me despite my 40+ years  Rarely does a book about cancer make one laugh out loud on one page and then come to tears on the next  I loved this book and like some of the other people who read this book too quickly wished that I had taken more time to enjoy it  Please don't misunderstand me when the book was over I was satisfied with the ending  I just wish that it hadn't ended Strangely I wish I had a chance to visit with these friends a little bit longer
This is one of the best books I have read in a very long time  I have read and reread it several times and tell everyone they too must read it  The phrasing by the author is unique and deserves rereading  I actually reread many paragraphs just so I could enjoy the wording again  The characters are great  They become so real that you actually do celebrate their accomplishments and grieve their losses  I hope if they make a movie of this; which I would love to see; they don't change the story one bit  It deserves to be portrayed just as it is
Great book  Very thought-provoking  I liked it much better than Green's Looking for Alaska
What a great read I enjoyed it Add to your reading list soon I'm sad to reach the end I want more
great book  heartfelt portrayal of two teens having to face death and the injustice of it all  bravo

This book is amazing you learn a lot from it it is a must readI loved it this is such a good book
I absolutely loved this book There was nothing not to love in this book It is a must read on my list
It was a good book but not really my type  It was reccommended by a friend  A little too dark for me
I *LOVED* Looking For Alaska and before The Fault in Our Stars none of the more recent John Green's quite measured up (though they are all great) but this this is John Green at his best  What I love most about John Green is the beauty cadence rhythm of his write  I love to read his novels aloud They ready like finely written verse  Add in his ability to bring wit humor and charm to a book that on the surface seems like it would be entirely depressing and in my opinion this book highly deserves every award its won  Well done John Green
This amazing piece of literature has taught me some of the unseen points in life Hazel has a humorous look on her situation that gives even the tiniest hint of enlightenment on to this tragic story that propelled me through this book with tears streaking down my face To the weak of heart I do not recommend this to you but I highly appraise this as one of the more glorious of books that I have read in my being on this earth The fault is not in our stars but in our ambitious nature as humans but after all isn't that what makes us human

 Ow My feelsThats all i have to say That and don't read this book in class like me
I really like this book even though I'm a guy that it talked into reading it Amazing book right here
This is such a beautiful book By far the best one I've ever read Would recommend to everyone I know
I Really enjoyed the book  Makes you think about life  A quick read I recommend it Very touching 
This is the best book I have ever read John Green is solo talented and I recommend this book for all
This book is a quick read and John Green keeps the reader engaged My favorite John Green book by far
This was a very good book It was sad It was happy It was touching I would definitely recommend it
This is a well written story It is easy to fall in love with the characters Have a tissue box close
I am not overstating it when I say that this is the best Young Adult book that I have ever read It is in my top 3 favorite books of all time behind only The Great Gatsby and Ender's Game The wonderful thing is this book has intentional tie-ins to The Great GatsbyAll I can tell you is to read it I'm afraid anything I write even in praise of the book will not do it justice I will suffice to say that it is a perfect combination of subtle hints of philosophy intertwining with an accurate depiction of love loss and death
This is probably more a book for teens than adults but as an adult I really enjoyed it  It was a real account of a teenager living with late-stage cancer and all its difficulties  However although I anticipated that it would tug at my heart strings and become sappy it didn't  In fact a lot of it was pretty funny  I loved that the main characters acted like teenagers even though in some respects they had to face some very grown up issues I highly recommend this book  Great writing very engaging  Look for more from John Green
I purchased this for my daughter in the Kindle edition  I know this novel is a wonderful read but I did NOT pay this price for incomplete sentences and major errors and she is only on page 49  We both have seen a paragraph incomplete where it stops in the process of a sentence and there also have been sentences and quotes that are left hanging on the page without completion  Paying over $700 I believe this is unacceptable  It's more than annoying to read with so many mistakes and I am sure the author wouldn't appreciate it either
I was looking for something different to read and randomly selected this book on the reccomendation of amazon I stayed up all night reading it as I could not put it down I laughed and cried often at the same time This book was so beautifully written and the characters so real I did not even realize that hours had gone by John Green is an extremely powerful writer and developed characters so sarcastic charming and loveable I will now begin reading everything he has written with the hopes that they are all just as amazing as this
My daughter absolutely enjoyed the book Had it read in 2 days Although it is bit sad for me though
A great love story Sad but so unconditional Really led me to think of ways I can grow as as person
This was an awesome book with an amazing story I couldn't put it down This is a must read for sure
If you are looking for a tear-jerker here it is  Sweet story that seems written to go to Hollywood
Absolutely loved it I cried so many tears at the end it is ridiculous I recommend this to everyone
the book was almost brand new smelled like it had been in storage but that was it what a great price
This book was one of the best books I've read in a long time Funny and sad I could not put it down
It was formulaic and I'm far too old for the story but I liked it It's a nice quick vacation read
This book made me cry at first but it's amazing John Green u r fantastic and such a good writer
I loved it It was sad but happy at the same time There was a twist when he died instead of her
favorite book its amazing its really sad though i would recommend this book who i think can handle it
Great book I have no idea why they call it a teen or young adult book It's a must reds for any age
Good la la la I liked this book yay for John green the movie was great to yay happiness is all around

I really like this book it was a good book and had some good choice of words I loved the book so much
Sad in a humor ridden morose way Life death and the pain of being human It makes you think 
The fault in our stars was a heart warming book It tools me only 2 days to read It was so romantic
Love it Love it Love it  And now for fourteen more words that I am required to write in my review

If all we are in this world is molecules bumping into each other how do we feel breathe and think
The ending could have been more dramatic but overall a pretty good book I will go see the movie now
It was ok There were cute moments and it was a nice story but I don't think its worth all the hype

i love it it was just oh my gosh great i cried and laughed it was fantastic i wish it was longer
Such a great book I understand it is going to be made into a movie I hope it does the book justice
I originally read this book after seeing the previews for the movie  Thinking I wanted to read the story before seeing the movie  I felt it was well written Read the book on my riding in my van pool and on my lunch hours and towards the end at home  Lots of tears while there were humorous parts as well  Sweet sweet love story  I have no doubt that the while there were two of us in the van that read the book I'm pretty sure the rest of the lady riders will be reading this as well We gave them just enough to make them curious
I'm a middle-aged man I read a lot of fiction I came to this w/ some trepidation; aware of it's young adult target but read some glowing reviews and am always intrigued by this subject matter mostly because it's always dismayingly and disappointingly handled so poorly Not this time What a revelation  this book and author John Green turned out to be Smart sensitive insightful gorgeous writing This one will stay with me It will stay with you  I feel like a young adult wise beyond the years Read this best book of 2012
It took 20 minutes from the moment I closed this book to the moment that my throat decided to re-opened and the valves that control the pipes to my eyes finally shutThis book is not perfect I found the beginning a bit choppy and the dialogue unrealistic in the first few scenes But wow this book is good The 20 minutes I spent crying after I finished this book were not self-indulgent moments they were legit gdamn stop sobbing it's 3 in the morning and I have to wake up early inconvenient but appreciated emotions
my 14 yo daughter and I read through this as expected before seeing it in the theater Really good
Well written love story but depressing story about illness and death involving teen cancer patients
I hadn't read any other book like this one  It does keep the reader wanting to continue to the end
Just read it The author is amazing and makes a cancer book not about cancer He is a very wise man
This is the first time reading a John Green novel I enjoyed the story and the characters' personas
I chose this rating because think that  this book brings alot of feeling and it shows us what we can
Love love love this book I could read it over and over and never get enough My desert island book
It was very sad at times but sure gave one an insight into young cancer patients A very good read
sadder than I expected a book about two kids with cancer to be  I don't know what to feel about it
Haven't even read the book yet and it's making me wrote a review before I can turn the page Stupid
Total tear jerker but totally worth it It's so easy to get lost in for hours I recommend it highly
An intelligently written book about teens dealing with cancer  Beatifully sad yet stunningly witty
Makes me believe in love again :)Thanx Mr John Green from now on u have a big fan from Asia
This book is so touching and meaningful I love it so much I can't stop reading it Please read it
Even we get to the Going rate for a girl of my husband and The only ankles and the girl I don't know
I was in tears finishing this book I couldn't take it The ending made me sob even more Good story
this book will make you cry tears of joy and happiness will be there through out the book just great
This is the best book ever even though it made me cry I would totally read this book if I were you
Holy this is my most totes fave book everFEEELS Wow wow wow wow wow wow wow wow wow wow wow
this was a very good book sad but it lets you know what people with cancer go thru really enjoyed it
Beautiful I might read more about sad books like that out of all my book I've read this is the best
Read it before you watch the movieYou will not regret a minute spent in the world of this book
Very well written  Great story and since I cried in the book I know I do not need to see the movie
What a cute love story How sad it would be to loose a child to cancer  Hopefully they find a cure
A new angle at live with and dealing with cancer Super easy to read and could not put the book down
It's a good read quick Sad and also heartfelt  Well written and developed characters  Funny too
Doesn't go the way you think it will But you love the people enough to stay with them the whole way

Love the book and the movie Best book ever I can't wait to finish it Thanks for making this book
good little love story but not too much more than that going on didn't hate it but didn't love it
Interesting because it is from the teenage cancer victim's point of view Almost a one-sitting read
Wonderful read  Considered a young adult book it is well written and enjoyable for adults as well
My daughter read it and loved it; I read it and cried my eyes out Very good book for a 13 year old

This book was amazing It was the kinda romance that I love It was dark sad and sweet I loved it
I don't want to see the movie for fear it would ruin the book This was a fantastically great story
A well-written book and a good read but spoiler alert to use a phrase used in the book it is sad
I wasn't impressed with this book While it does pull at my heart it's just wasn't my type of read
I wanted to read before I saw the movie  Made me cry  That author of the favorite book was a jerk
What a great story of love loss and life  This book is sad but it is also real and heart warming
I really liked the book alot  Had a twist in it I never expected  Now I am ready to see the movie
Kept me interested but have to say I didn't feel like it lived up to the hype Overall an okay book
A piece of fiction that needs to be read John Green is a truly talented author Simply a must read

Super good; great plot I loved it and heard about because of a friend I bawled my eyes out loved it

I am speechless Recommend for ages 11+ If you are prepared to cry than this is the book for you
So enjoyed the cynicism and sarcasm; loathed the poetry It was worth the 3 days it took to read it
The story concept is a unique concept about a topic needing a little light shed on it in my opinion
This is a really great book I suggest that you read it it has some sad parts and lots of happy parts
As lovely as it is heartbreaking  I read it in a night I couldn't put it down  A worthwhile read

Made me cry And not a lot of books can do that to me Definitely recommend this book Sooooooo good
This book is a young but witty love story that can be appreciated by all A GREAT LIGHT SUMMER READ
I swore this book wouldn't make me cryand I was wrong Partly because I didn't like the character I'd assumed was going to die first partly for the loss of young loveAs the mother of teenagers I found the author had a very convincing teenage voice Although that can sometimes be very annoying trust meI know this is a work of fiction but the way Hazel spoke to Peter Van Houten didn't seem convincing I also found their reunion to be contrived and unlikelyBut if you need a good cry this book's for you
The Fault in Our Stars was one of those books you just can't put down I loved everything about it
It's a remarkable feat to make me laugh and cry at the same time Well done John Green Well done
It is an awesome book It is well written and is great just like the movie I recommend you get it
Great summer read  I have not seen the movie - I am not sure how it could be better than the book
I enjoyed the characters and the way the author dealt with hard topics like cancer and forgiveness
Had heard it was good but it was not my favorite although it held my interest enough to finish it
Most entertaining and unusual story of dealing with illness and loss from patient's point of view

This book had perfect quotes and I love it and would recommend it to anyone I love this book a lot
There were pages in the book that were awesome but I thought overall the book somewhat dragged on
Couldn't put this book down Except until I got to the end as I did not want to be finished with if

This has been the best book I've ever read it's changed me for the better Great job very well done
One of the best books I've ever read Considering that this is my first book I'm proud I chose it
I laughed I cried I learned I enjoyed What more can one ask of a book I'd recommend it highly
I am truly madly deeply in love with this book I cannot describe in words what it means to mexx
This was a great book for my book club not just for YA Must read if you know someone with cancer
Even though it was 300 pages long I was sad it had to end so soon Makes you smile laugh and cry
It was good and filled what I was looking for in a book It will keep dragging you in so watch out
This book kept me reading but no tears shed As high up as this book is on this invisible pedestal it wasn't a great read to me seeing that it was narrated by hazel i knew she wasn't going to pass I was reading this book anticipating gus's death and when it happened it was just eh Being a mother myself i took on this book with the mind set of becoming attached but instead found myself very distant and not really engaged or enthused about what the next chapter would bring the ending in itself was all around terrible
I chose this rating because this book means everything to me it is the perfect love story I never got tired or bored of reading this book In fact I have read this book three times and every time I cry Why did Augustus Waters have to die Anyways there are no dislikes I like everything about this book And the awesome part is that I get to see hazel Grace and Augustus Waters in divergent I am going to see TFIOS movie on Friday so anyways if I had to rate this book out of ten I would rate it a 10000000000000000000000/10
As in terms of an amazon product yes the book was in great shape and shipped very fast  In terms of content don't waste your money  Yeah it's a popular book right now but if you're over the age of 16 don't even bother  From the beginning you think you know what's going to happen until about the middle of the book and then you know how it will end  Really don't waste your time with it  Please read some good literature  On one hand I'm glad I read it so I can say how predictable and unoriginal the story is
This book has been one of the best books I've read in awhile I couldn't put it down but when it ended I was slightly upset This book is an emotional roller coaster It made me laugh at loud angry happy nostalgic excited and depressed The plot was unique at least from what I usually read (favorites: Mitch Albom Jodi Picoult Laurie Halse-Anderson) and I never thought that it was boring I yearn for more but in the end there is no way to make this book better I will be looking into more of John Green's books
Great book Bought as a Christmas gift Excellent prices and extremely fast shipping Great dealer
I am required to write twenty words to leave my review of a book that is phenomenal Just read it
Heard a lot of good things about this book so purchased it for our Kindle library Loved the book
This book does bring many tears but I did love the make up of all  the characters and the flow
It was direct and lively We all need to be that courageous In life and love it just makes sense
I read the book than saw the movie - often times the books are better I feel the movie was better
I loved it so much and I also cried a Little but it's so good and u wish there was another  Morgan
This book is one of the best I've ever read It's a real tear jerker Best book and super realist

Seiously a cute &amp; addictive book I thought the storyline between them was great Great movie too
Awesome story Words can't express it I am in love with their love I am in love with this book

Great movie and book I am glad I chose to read the book after watching the movie It was awesome
An absolute must read  Not your typical happy ever after book but soooooo well written
If my sister would have ruined part of the book I would have been brought to tears so  very good

This was such an easy read hard to put down once you start kind of books  I highly recommend it

The fault in our stars by John Green is so good I love it I recommend it to everyone out there
This made me cry A lot If that doesn't make you want to read this book I don't know what will
All I can say is TISSUE LOTS OF IT I haven't cried that hard for a book in over a year Bravo
Great book My twelve year old loves this book Finished it in 1 week it was that good Love it
This is the best book that I have read in a very long time Thank you Shana for the suggestion
Such a great easy read full of useful quotes I loved this little story I didn't want it to end
This book is so good and John Green is a very talented author I'll go read his other books now
I can't stop cryingThis has to be the the best book I've read in years I never want it to end
I am in absolute awe of how much enjoyed this book It brought me to tears but was still joyous
It is amazing  I am looking forward to seeing the movie It is the first book that made me cry
Simply one of the best books I`ve read in my life Thanks to John Green for such a piece of art
This book was great and caught my interest from the first page It is a great read for all ages
One of the best books I've read Pulls you into the story I can't wait to read his other books
If you haven't drained your tear ducts in a while this story will take care of that in no time
I'm a big fan of Green's earlier work - I'd recommend any of his books - and this one lived up to my expectations Given the subject matter it takes a skilled writer to not let the story spiral into a maudlin sappy mess and Green is one of the best - the novel will make you laugh and cry and it never pulls at the heartstrings just to evoke a reaction The characters are terrific and just when you think you've got it figured out a small twist changes the direction of the story  Just a great great read
I haven't read a good book ever since the hunger games and I was hoping this was going to change that I cried more during the two days it took me to read this book then ever before I LOVED how the book was written and how there were various twists I thought that the book was going to end with her dying but it didn't I couldn't put the book down and if it weren't for school i would have finished it in only one day This book has now claimed a spot next to the hunger games' as one of my favorite books
I volunteer at the Schneider Children's Hospital in Israel the terminal Oncology ward and purchased this book for our teenagers Even though I shed a few tears while reading this book I also laughed a lot The kids know how to live with their cancer and this book shows it is true When my son was diagnosed with cancer I told him we Will learn to live with it the best we can there were tears but also lots of laughter I loved it because it is true to life but not morbid Good work John Green and thanks
I in my opinon stand out among my friends with my reading qualities I love to read but can never seem to get what I want in a book Instead of reading some 75 page book just to get credits I alwats find myself reading not even in the teen but the adult novel section This book is one of the most engaging yet touching books I have ever read It took me a day and a half to eat up this book For me it was very symbolic (in a good way) I just couldn`t get enough Well written and worth every moment
The sheer rawness of The Fault in Our Stars is completely outrageous I mean who would have the nerve to write something to absolutely honest or so unimaginably true to life Who writes about a girl in a book whom is obsessed with a book about a girl in her exact situation Tis madness The Fault in Our Stars displays nearly every attribute necessary to make a good book--and it displays them well I have a feeling John Green going to go down in history as one of Those Authors if you know what I mean
I found it a very good read but very sad and sometimes a little confusing  But I did enjoy it
Left me speechless It was so sad but so good at the same time I couldn't put it down Love it
I couldn't make it past the second chapter  I found the book to be very boring and predictable
loved this book even though it is rated as a youth book  Good example of unconditional caring
I did enjoy reading this book  I love learning about the characters  It was hard to put down
I was told that I would just love this book but it is not for adult men like I was told it was
It had one particular outlandish aspect I just couldn't get into But great characters and sad
I find the writing pretty pretentious but it does have a good amount of humor and was enjoyable
Great book and super fast shipping Every female in our family has borrowed my copy to read it
tHIS IS A LOVE STORY WITH A TWIST THAT HAS BEEN MADE INTO A MOVIE  iT MAKES YOU LAUGH ANS CRY
This is a book that not only makes you think but also requires you to feel I give it 5 stars
If we could all be so smart in analogy Best description on life that I think I have ever read
It was a little bit sad in places but it makes up for it by being hilarious It's a must read
this book was a very good book probably be of the best I've read I could read this book again

This book is definitely a tear jerker but so worth the read I can't wait to see the movie now
Not written in teenager vernacular So stupid to promote that there is No after life There is
This book is so sad but happy at the same time John Green is one of the best writers ever
Dem feels is all I have to say I loved this book so much I reread it And that's saying a lot
Very good read It is short and sweet but not very sweet at the same worth the time Must read

I hope the movie is just as great as the book I have a great understanding of cancer and death
Wow I loved the characters we are born to die is what we do in the mean time that is important
I love the book but dislike the way it ends other than that it's the best book that I have read
I love it Can't wait to see the movie Great story line and how the book turn out Love it
I really like this book but I wish it made them be together longer I want it to be a sequel

An incredible book You'll likely get lost in it I didn't expect to enjoy it as much as I did
I couldn't put this book down Reallly read it in 3 days Gives you a whole new outlook on life
I loved it so much I wish I could erase my mind and go back and read the beautiful words again
this book is an amazing love story and its also funny ill reread it and reread it until I did

Having read this book I have found hope in love in life and in death Long love Gus and Hazel
This book is the best book that you will ever readYou need to get this book and read it

I loved this book I have never cried so hard this is a very powerful book and a must read
so good and made me cry it touched my heart did not want the story to end though good author
I have to say I heard a lot about this book and it definitely did not disappoint me so good
I don't think a book has ever effected me like this one did  And I thank you so much for that
I have almost nothing to say except this book is so thought provoking and it is a must read it
Fell in love with characters By far the best thing I have read all year It will be a classic
A great book I felt like I had first time fallen in love all over again A must read for all
Oh my God such a sad good funny happy but sad book I loved it I don't like the ending though
I have to admit that I wasn't aware that this was a YA book I also have to admit that this is the first time that I have reviewed anything before now Haven't made these admissions I can honestly say that I enjoyed this book cover to cover The characters are so well developed that I felt I knew them One might think that a book about terminally ill teenagers would be maudlin and overly sentimental It is neither of these things Absorbing and entertaining and thoroughly readable Give it a shot
There are good books and then there are captivating books and this is one of those rarities i literay did not put this book down for longer then five minute and despite the fact that im going to be running on a very small amount of sleep  for school tomorrow it was totally worth it there has only been three books that have kept me up becuase i simply didnt want to return to reality and i am quite pleasured that this could be one of those books Beautiful and astonishing (16 loserchild veiwpoint)
My 25 year old son was reading this and recommended I read it  I think after reading it that I had read it before but this second time made it as sweet and memorable as the first  We had a similar comment in our house for different reasons to not use the cancer card so this bool reads close to the heart and very sweet  It is not for one who dones not appreciate a true and romantic book about young love but it is one that I enjoyed and will read again and again to remind myself how lucky I am
Good of its kind for teenagers interested in coping with the difficulties of cancer treatment
Very thoughtful and insightful to those suffering and coping with terminal cancer  Good read
I could not put this book down And of course I cried like a baby too Definitely a good read
This is a very thought full book about living dying and loving The characters are well done
An amazing read I bought it because it's one of those books you can read over and over again
I'd give this book a hundred stars if I could Tragic intelligent humorous beautiful story
Horribly boring If the book was this bad I can't even imagine the movie Ugh so disappointed
Oh my gosh I have no words but the ones I am currently speaking No words at all Okay Okay
Great book for teen and adult alike  My daughter and I both read it and discussed it together

That was great  It felt real as if i felt her pain And the ending was perfect So incredible
I had to read this for a school assignment and it was very good  I enjoyed the book very much
Beautiful  This word popped into my head the moment I finished The Fault in Our Stars  Other words of course come to mind now: funny bittersweet troubling honestbut I think my first word says it best  A good book is hard to find  This book is a GOOD book  Yes it's well written and witty and captures something true (to be cliche) but it's more than the sum of its parts  It's a perfect storm  Read it to laugh  Read it to cry  Read it to feel human  It's small but beautiful
I teach high school English I got this book for my classroom library I cannot keep it on my shelf One of my students insisted that I read The Fault in Our Stars I read it in two days Could not put it down I laughed and I cried The English nerd in me loves how the title relates back to the line in Shakespeare's Julius Caesar (spoken by CassiusThe story of Hazel and Augustus will appeal to both teens and adults I think it is truly one of the best books I've read this year
A tear jerker but wonderful insights into some special teenagers coping with life and death
No words for that ending Never liked stories targeted to YA but this one was something else
It is a favorite in my book it had some good moments in it and at some parts I may have cryed
FooThe fact I can read it in a while ago but the fact get it right away and I love the
It's for me at least not as good as the movie I know that's very unusual but there you go
Just couldn't get into the book after seeing the movie  Maybe should of read the book first
The prose was wonderfulHalf way through though I lost a sense of it taking me somewhere
Great book Definitely recommend Was full of sarcastic wit and heart wrenching story telling
Beautiful storyA story of strength and courage to the youngans who face the unimaginable
This book was amazing and I recommend this book to people at the age 10 and up IT WAS AMAZING
One of the few instances in which the movie did a better job telling the story than the book
An amazing book can't wait to see if the movie measures up A part 2 I can only hope so
This is a great book it has a lot of meaning and is well written I enjoyed this great book
It was a great read even though I kinda had an idea what was coming I couldn't stop reading
My daughter cried the last 7 chapters She loved it so much I could not get her to go to bed
It was ok not that intriguing sometimes it dragged on and on but overall I liked it a lot too
Great story didn't like the ending  What happened to the girl in the movie did she die too

Such an amazing but yet so sad book loved it would read it again Saw the movie the other day
Endearing story of two young people in love  Heartbreaking for all to know of life so short
The Fault in the Stars is a beautiful story that creates real emotion to the point of tears
Who doesn't love this book I just wish there would have been more at the endor a 2nd book
It was so moving It really pushes you to see the world in a different light-wow what a book
It was a good but sad book I guess now I have to watch the movie I will recommend this book
Not a fan of the ending but can kind of see it because of the book Hazel was always reading
Fantastic story - about love true relations and feelings care struggle loss and sorrow
Simple story of love sorrow strength of character told in a warm kind and enjoyable way
Loved loved loved this book A great fast read You just want to keep turning the pages
started out slow then picked up easy read for a rainy day sweet characters also very sad
Just read this book - for not reading this gem of a novel would be a fault in your own stars
The book was a little slow and went no where some times it was ok but not a favorite of mine
John Green is a talented writer and of course I loved it Besides I am a teen girl after all
Hi I like this book very much thank you for the little infinity John Green and now it is over

I could never write as eloquently as John Green so I will not try  This book is so funny and well-written that my bed shook as I read it and as I ignored my children for hours  I must mention that I was also crying simultaneously  Hard to believe but true  I haven't cried this much since The Notebook  This book is so worthy of being read  I have about 10 pages left and don't want to finish  I am so afraid it will not have an ending  Love Love Love (2 loves more than usual)
It's one of the most wonderful books I ever wrote and I keep reading it over and over again

I cried like a baby but it really makes me love life way more than I thought I already did
It was the best book i have read in a long time or ever It is most definitely a must read
I choose the rating 5 because this book made me cry my eyes out  The simple straightforward language makes it truly believable that this is a narration by a teenager The big takeaway from this book for me was to remind myself of carefree childhood days and to look at things using my own lenses rather than through the filter of years of experience which age inevitably piles on us A very easy read too  finished it in about 4 hours Its fast pace never lets you keep the book down
This was the saddest book I've ever read - and I read a lot I highly recommend it to anyone Anyone It was touching and I can truly say that The Fault in Our Stars was literally the best book I've ever readThe best part - and saddest was how real he made it It wasn't some tragic story where everything fell apart It was all good until tragedy struck And that tragedy could happen to anyone The book touched my heart in ways no book ever has Thank you John Green
I CAN'T EVEN TELL YOU HOW AMAZING THIS BOOK IS It is no short of genius It's touching It makes you cry And I realize people don't always like to read books that make them cry but the way the book makes you think and makes you laughed and makes you cry it is quite simply the textbook definition of a New York Times Bestseller I cannot do this book justice with my mere words not so eloquently arranged as John Green's I can simply tell you to buy it and read it for yourself
Dank The book was dank I might call it dope Maybe I don't know how to read to be honest

This book is so real Very good read I love this book I hope you like it as much as I do

Loved it from beginning to end  I loved the dialogue banter between the main characters

It was such an amazing book I loved it it only took me a day to read it's so addicting
Loved This is a great read It ended too soon I read it in a day and a half off and on
always makes me cry but it's the best book I've ever read and I'm just so in love with it
A great read for all ages I laughed and cried One of my favorite s this year so far :)
I think it is great because it is telling opinions in it  and it's just great üòç so yeah
A must read Can't wait for the movie I hope it's half as good as the book if not better
I read this book in 3 days I really liked it Can't wait til the movie come out in June
I don't even mind that it made me cry Yes it was that good  That is all I have to say
This is the best book I've ever read in my entire life I need not elaborate Oh my god 
I don't even like to read but I could not get my nose out of this book  Best book ever
I recommend this to teen girls it is a great novel lol I cried twice I love it thank you
It ends as if it wasnt ending:) i absolutely love it and thats all i hav  to say about it
I thought this was a very good book I finished in 3 days and I couldn't put the book down
I picked this book up expecting another great read from John Green and indeed I was not dissatisfied The book was everything I expected and more From the beginning I became attached to the characters and the plot Though it took me a while to finish I had a blast reading it and laughed out loud many times (a side of reading Green's books) I hope that John Green continues to produce  awesome works like this one and providing his readers with another gem on paper
I must admit I was not sure I wanted to read this novel at first given its heavy subject matter but now I am truly happy I did Greens characters were so like able and realistic that I couldn't help but wish they were my actual friends His skillful writing had me laughing crying and just about everything in between I would highly recommend this book to anyone and everyone This story will stay with me for a long long time In my eyes it is literary perfection
I thought this book was highly overrated by all the reviews saying it was a five star book Although it was interesting and possibly authentic in cancer treatments support groups and the way teens speak to each other it was difficult wading through all the 'cuteness' to get close enough to the characters to actually care about them I did not 'cry buckets' at the end After all the hype and advance build-up of the book I was disappointed it didn't deliver more
I went into this book not knowing anything about it My friends refused to tell me anything except that it is the best book they have ever read I trusted them but was still skeptical and I am so glad I did This book was amazing and deffinatly one of my altime favorites One minute you will be laughing and the next you will be crying But I urge you to read it with either no or minimal knowledge of it and trust that it will be good It's the best way to read it
This is a beautiful story It made me happy sad angry It made me laugh cry and long for a boyin a bookthat is only fiction Oh but how  Mr John Green made the characters come to life and made you feel like you were in their world with them If only for a little whileSo again I will say beautiful This is a book worth reading It is one of those stories that stays with you Even after I finished the book and put it away I am still thinking about it
This is the story of two adolescents both who have or who have had life threatening cancers  The plot isn't major but is just a spine around which the sensibility of the novel wraps itself  And it's that they go to Amsterdam to visit the author of a book that has inspired both of them and are disappointed in the author  There are plot reversals (I won't be a spoiler) and I found the characters and their relationship moving  It's a quick and engaging read
I love this story  I have watched the movie multiple times as well as reading the book
An incredible story based on situations that we are living so often in these last years
Authentic Real descriptions Real dialogues Real story beginning and ending Loved it
Great insight for teens and up concerning the realities of living and dying with cancer
This book was even better than the movie and I did not think that was possible excellent
It's a great book sad but still imbedded with hilarious stories Thank you John Green
Very childish book I have no idea what compelled me to buy it Can't believe Gus dies
Very fun book even with a sad ending Written in a young style it's very easy to read
I am so impressed Somethings are cliches but it's ok Hazel and Augustus made it fade
I purchased this book for my Kindle  I enjoyed this book  It is a great and easy read
Great book My daughter read it first then gave it to me One of my all time favorites
Of all the books I have read this is the one story I hope to carry forever in my heart
its my favorite english book so far I always read spanish version but this is SO GREAT
It was OK Not one of my favorites  but my 8th graders seem to enjoy reading this book
I did not write a review of this and I am not a nurse Looking into how to delete this

This book is a book which teaches you that don't give up when all odds seem against you

I also love reading the book before seeing the movie and this proved to be a great read
Perfect book in every single way you could review a book My pleasure to read this book

It's a very emotional story which I could not put it down Cannot wait to see the movie

This book was on my summer list of must reads and I'm so glad I did Highly recommended
It was really a pretty good book in general It's kind of like our generation's Titanic
One of the best  books I have read in a long time For once the movie is almost as good

I loved it it was so emotional I cried and felt like i was in the book at alot of parts
All I have to say is have a box of tissues ready You're going to need them by the end
I loved it It made me laugh and cry I have never loved a book so much I am a huge fan
I cried It was so good so good I cried it was the best book I've ever read in my life
John Green captivated my attention right away - this book has instantly become my favourite ever As a 16 year old girl I know that teen fiction in this day and age is typically nonsense but John Green truly gives me hope His writing is so intense and - for fiction - so lifelike He doesn't shy away from negative situations I felt like I could understand Hazel not feel sorry for her If you haven't bought and read this book I suggest you do Right now
I had never read a John Green book before This was an amazing book I gave the book 5 stars because it was a great read for both boys and girls I am an art teacher and talk often with my students about the books they read I suggest this book often The students love it The story if the two falling in love through dealing with their cancer is amazing I was literally taking a bubble bath reading the end and was sobbing at the end It was an amazing read
<a class=a-link-normal href=/The-Fault-in-Our-Stars/dp/B005ZOBNOI>The Fault in Our Stars</a>¬†Before I purchase any book I always look at both the 5 star reviews and the one star reviews in order to decide whether or not to read it There very few one star reviews and my review is no exception This is one of those books that I think fifty years from now teachers will require their students to read it because it has become a classic This book is very moving and thought-provoking Live your best life today
Even though this book was supported by countless nerdfighters before it was even released John Green did not disappoint As a lover of books in general it is safe to say i have read a lot of novels but this is my favorite book EverThe characters were lovable and the message was both clear and deep in ways only John Green can I laughed I cried and I shoved this book at anyone who would take it Please read this book I promise you'll love it
A tear-jerker for sure  A very sweet book  I really like John Green's writing style
Worth the read Quick read aswell Looking forward to reading other books by John green
It was really enjoyable:) I watched the movie as well and wasn't as good as the book
Powerful book; I haven't seen the movie yet but the book was definitely worth reading
Very good A sad story but the protagonist keeps you hooked with her witty narratives
Very wel written  I had trouble determining the meaning in the title  I did enjoy it
Great for 18-22 But since I'm a little older I found it slightly corny I cried anyway
This book did not have a good start to it but overall it was just an okay book to read
This is a very good book  Easy to read and keeps you interested from beginning to end
One of the best books I've read in a lomg timetook me 6 hours to read front to back
Amazing A delicate subject of dying handled beautifully and with such wit and realism
excellent book could not put it down very bitter sweet but part of real lifeppl
Amazing book I loved every second of it Definitely a book I'd recommend to my friends

Like Hazel wanted to know what happened to Anna I want to know what happened to Hazel
I LOVED IT it was just so amazing and i wanna read more by john green  very good book
Good book overall Was sad but not blubbering-like-a-baby sad as so many described it
I bought this book for my 9th grade son Delivery was so fast Thank you for your work
Good book sad but we all have someone that has or had cancer in our lives Hits home
The two kids are much too literary smart and wise Otherwise a pretty gripping book
this is an amazing book and it took me on an emotional ride it was totally amazing
Excellent book but highly emotional  My heart was on a roller coaster the entire read
Very well written and will have you hanging on Hazel's every word from start to finish

As a cancer survivor I found this book well written insightful and funny Great read
The Fault In Our Stars was the best book I loved it so much I suggest you read it :)
It took a while to get into the story but after a few chapters I couldn't put it down
Great Book I couldn't put it down I would still like to know what happens to 
Held my attention after the first chapter hard getting interested the beginning pages
Excellent literature disguised in a riveting story line and good character development
Great sad quick read Couldn't put it down It's worth your time and your reflection
It was a sad book but the difficulty of the medical terms made me think more than cry
Didn't see the movie My Grandaughter and I read it at the same time We both loved it

This is the best it beats all the rest The best book I ever read in my life ever ever

Great read Cried my eyes out It was one of the best books I have read in a long time
Read it It's the best book I have ever read and I can't wait for the movie to come out
I loved it It was so sad but I couldn't put it down I even got my friend to read it
There is so much depth and color in the world of literature and this book is a perfect example of that Green has this style that I've yet to see in any other YA fiction -- hilarious and poignant sweet but raw His characters are not easily forgotten and they are so hard to say goodbye to I hated coming to the end of this book hated knowing that my time in Hazel Grace's world was up This story will break your heart if you let it but it's worth it
Other reviewers have given you the synopsis of this wonderful story so my addition has little to add Luckily I read a magazine review which lead me to this book so I wasn't at all aware it is classified as a Young Adult read What it actually is is a Must Read for everyone who has experienced cancer in their family and everyone who hasn't That being said just buy the book It's marvelous enchanting and every other accolade a novel can achieve
I knew this story might be interestinggiven they made a Hollywood film about it I just felt the movie would be trite tale of teenage love and loss I will let you know once I see the movie if I was right Sometimes these books choose us when we need them I am about to lose another family member and in that rexamining all that I believe and hope to be true That I hope I helped one person and hurt no one  That's all we can hope to leave as a legacy
no many words needed for this story is just so heartbreaking but a beautiful story
interesting story good character development and insight into the minds of teenagers
This was a cd book There were no scratches or problems It was exactly as advertised
My daughter was excited to receive the book It was clean and new I'm very satisfied
I don't like the ending but it was great I want to know if hazel dies or not and when
A beautiful story of young love with a twist that will make you reach for your tissue
Beautifully well written story that captivated me from beginning to end A great read
I didn't want to finish it One of the characters is among the finest I have ever met
Awesome book l love It so much it is so so so so so so so so  amazing ilysm john green

this is a amazing book OMG it made me cry but this was the best book I have ever read
Awesome heart wrenching story Excellent writing You feel like you are in the story

Wonderful passionate story I was not able to put it down Well worth the short read
I give it 4 stars only because I ididn't like the ending - it left me with no closure
A lovely story a lot of tears towards the end - I look forward to watching the movie
Not bad but not brilliant either Can be a bit waffley at times but easy enough read
I love how the movie plot went in comparison to this book But all in all a good read
It was dad while being a great book it kid now my favorite book I hope you like it too
great book and I really like it a lot I am glad that I got to read this book thank you
This book is just amazing  I loved it so much I just can't explain how great it is 
This is a book for teenagers- my daughter is 12 so I read it too- sad but a good read-
I loved it It was a great story And I can't wait to see the movie It is sad though
it was a nice story i am just not a huge fan of love stories it's sweet and very sad
I Usually don't read books and don't like to read put I love th I s book it is amazing
It is a Very good and realistic story but its a bit too sad for me Not my cup of tea
So sad but the best book ever you have to read it I couldn't put it down Buy the Book
This book was a good book  it was very beautiful and I love how the book was so deep
I'll have to admit that the book is better than the moviehas more details and content The movie had a lot of posing and had to develop the story too quickly I liked the way the book seem to make each character fit their role I guess since I have cancer myself I don't like the over- protective parents However it is really the way the world in general treat people with cancer The book seemed to long and drawn out and I didn't like the ending
Amazon is pretty demanding they want you to rate well that's fine to ask me to spend a few minutes checking the stars rating the item but then to demand a certain number of words on the narrative Really  this is me doing them a favor why would you set a word limit  If you want people to take their valuable time give a reward you write more than a paragraph we give you a dollar credit or something  I'm not going to waste time rating any more
This book is without a doubt one of the best - if not the best - book I've ever read I laughed cried and fell in love along with the characters and couldn't imagine changing a word John Green is an absolute genius and connects to an audience that ranges from teenagers to the elderly I couldn't put this book down and still can't It changed my life and opened my eyes to just how lucky I truly am Read this book I guarantee you will love it
If you want to read a novel about two teenagers with cancer this is the one for you Although the subject matter is serious John Green manages to occasionally leaven it with humor The book had to compete with Hurricane Sandy for my attention the past two days and the fact that I couldn't put it down speaks to its excellenceJohn Green is the co-author of Will Grayson Will Grayson another fine book I urge you to read that also
What a great young adult book  All members of my adult book group really enjoyed it
It was a rivoting novel First I have read in a while that I didn't want to put down
Picked this up after seeing Me Earl and a Dying Girl Different but equally as good
This is a great book  Well written and you it was easy to relate to Good for  ages
It's a great book with a twist at the end and I rated it a 5 star because its AMAZING
My 12 year old grand daughter recommended I read this book It was a wonderful story
Saw the movie and read the book; the book is much better more complete  Nice story

I love this book there's nothing wrong with the book I'm glad I got it here in Amazon
A very moving story of a love that is doomed to be too short with a surprising twist
I'm a senior and I enjoyed the book but felt it would be  better read for a teenager
I like to read the book before I see a new movie The ending was a complete surprise
It was ok but not my kind of read  Too teenage for me with so many made-up words
I bought this for my daughter I'm rating based on her reaction She was very exited
Didn't want to read this book because I knew it would make me sad but it was so good
I felt the book was alluring It was written well and kept me what would happen next

This is a great book I didn't want to put it down I hope the movie does it justice
My daughter loved this book  I actually have never seen her read anything that fast
my daughters enjoyed it Great book not only for teen but for anyone who love people
This is such a good book I couldn't put it down and it gave me a lot to think about
The ending to the book so sad so be aware and that I warned you to get the tissue box
All I can say is to have tissues when you read this book and if you go see the movie
The book was great  loved it Can wait to see the movie hope it as good as the book

So sad but so good Read it in  25 days didn't want to put it down Best book evet
I HAVE NEVER CRIED SO HARD OVER A BOOK I loved it soO MUCH I can t wait for movie
It was a good book and I loved it so much and I don't want to right this review okay
I read it at the urging of my son - so glad I read it It is definitely a must read
LOVED IT Can't wait for the movie I read it in six hours and was sad it had to end
Read it in a day I was hooked and then it was over I can't wait to see the movie
This was so sad and I cried A LOT it was a great book and its such a good story
I read this book in about 6 hours it was that good I want to read more of his books
We had chosen this book for our book club and I thought it was terrific The story is sad and the reality is sadder but well written There were times however in the book that were not completely accurate regarding the oxygen My mom is currently on Oxygen so maybe I was silently monitoring that in the story because I feel when I am with her we are contantly monitoring the level in the tank I think this would be a good high school read
This book now stands on my shelf for favorite booksnext to a first English addition of Tom Sawyer I felt like I was seeing with the eyes of these exceptional teensteens living with terminal cancer How you can do this with humor respect and without it being depressingis amazing Every night I allowed myself a chapter so it did not go too fast Like a well-written piece of musicit ended with the same brilliance as it began
Labeling this YA lit does a disservice to the spectacular ease with which the author connects with readers of all ages Yes there is a teenaged protagonist but the wit and grace with which she deals with her own cancer and that of her support group will resonate with all This book is not depressing in fact it celebrates life in all its inconsistenciesI urge everyone to experience this amazing entertaining genius work
I received this book last night and I am already at the halfway point I would be done with it had I not gone to work today I love reading but I am a very picky reader I usually start a book and finish it only to finish it Rarely do I laugh out loud or shed a tear while reading or feel my chest pounding with excitement this book is a breath of fresh air I can't wait to turn the page so I am writing this review as fast as I can
I absolutely loved this book and I can't recommend it enough It is sad but beautifully so and makes you ask so many bigger questions in lifeThis was my first introduction to John Green and I have since purchased the other titles in his repertoire all of which I have also fallen head over heels for He's a fantastic story teller who is great at raising life questions without being preachy about it - five stars no question
I followed up Looking for Alaska with this book and was not disappointed
Completely satisfied with the quality &amp; time frame in which it arrived was correct
Young adults can relate to the teens in the story who fight debilitating illnesses
This was a good and quick read however it wasn't AS good as all the hype about it
Great book sort of sad but I didn't see the movie and the book didn't disappoint
I liked the book a lot It was sad in some parts but happy in other It is great hi
The fault in our stars was a great book just like the movie and it in spirard me
i love this book at the end it brought me to tears he wrote this so well i love it
Read this book in 24 hours Keeps you on you wanting more and more Loved this book
Fast read beautiful story Make sure to have a box of tissue close by as you read
This book was amazing it will make you cry and laugh It's a beautiful love story

Well written holds your interest sympathetic characters would make a good movie
I have no words to describe how in love I am with this book I am so glad I read it
Awesome Jk I've jjh have hggg hhhh gggg got to go bye got to go bye gg gg gggg g
This book was so sweet I loved it so much and I wish I did not end like that (tear)
I devoured this book in 3 says  And I have a 3 year old and 4 month old (no time)
This book is very good and I one of the best I have ever read It is also very sad
A page turner and great read you will love it and wont be able to put it down i bet
This book is so awesome and amazing I read it in 2 days and it was a great 2 days
Band hello hi why do I have to write this I don't want to bye the book is good  bye
I do not want to say too much but I will say this: read it and you won't be sorry
I avoided reading this book for quite some time due to other reviewers mentioning it was juvenile fiction  I finally read a sample on my Kindle and was immediately hooked  I am 54 and thoroughly enjoyed the book from start to finish  I will be reading more of John Green's books in the future  A book that is as well written as The Fault in Our Stars deserves to be read by people of all ages so don't be deterred by other reviews
It's not that I dont know what to sayi have thoughts about his books but my feelings toward it is greater than my thoughts and Im so afraid that my words cant say everything that i feel and think about this book and will ruin the whole review However in sum this book is deep it leaves me so many things to think aboutn it makes me feel lonely but know that i am not lonely at the same time It makes me feel complicated
One of the best Young Adult books I have ever read in my life There was a point at the end of a chapter where I had to physically restrain myself from throwing the book across the room because I was so angry with John Green for making my worst fears a reality I knew it was coming of course I did It didn't make it suck any less For once in my life I really was both laughing and crying at the same time Best tears of my life
I think that is the sweetest most amazing book ever I loved how everyone looked out for each other and the sweet thing Gus and hazel had I was very sad  when Gus died but it was going to happen to both of them anyway My top two favorite characters where Isaac and Gus they were the best of friends I thought hazel was a little to mean to her parents who did everything for her but other wise I love how Much she loved books
I'm not going to write a book report  I just don't have the time  I will say however I really did enjoy the hell out of this book  The characters Hazel and Augustus embody the greatest parts young life  I found myself rooting for them even when their situation was hopeless  Kinda like being a Miami Dolphins fan  This book was real and raw and sad but hopeful  Read it  It's $15 and a day out of your life well spent
It was good but I felt worse for the parents I guess I'm just not a romantic=\
Loved this book Such a turn of events that I did not see coming Wonderful story
Still thinking about these characters days after finishing the book  Great story
Not totally believable but tells the story of teens with terminal illnesses well
Amazingly for a story about teens with cancer I made me laugh out loud Loved it
Depressing and couldn't get in to it  I stopped halfway through which I never do
Great story and a really enjoyable read  Sad but well worth reading all the same
Sad moving story I'm almost afraid to watch the movie in case they ruined it
A little too involved with the writer guy-made it weird Skipped over some of that
I think there's a lot of hype about this story  It was a bit slow to get started
My daughter loves this book I just watched the movie and it was great Thank you
startlingly beautiful; heartbreaking yet uplifting;  very well written  Loved it
Good insight into the real side of being a terminally ill teenager Very good book
A truthful and witty account of living with an illness Well-written and engaging
Excellent book  Very well written and honest  I look forward to seeing the movie
Love the story u learn that u have the enjoy every minute with the ones u love
I was a bit concerned about the subject matter but found it to be A lovely book
It is the best book I've read in a long time and I'm glad it wasn't overly priced
very sad  excellent acting A good booster for someone suffering with depression
Good story from a child's point of view  Family sticking together through it all
Such an amazing book Couldn't put it down I highly recommend Very well written
I can't stop thinking about the characters in this story Brave smart and funny
What a wonderful beautiful story told so exquisitely by a master of our language

Best book I have read in a long time I loved it a lot Wish there was more to it
Oh My God It is one of the best books I have ever read You should go buy it now
This book is so ridiculously incredible I have been a John Green fan for years with my favorite being Paper Towns but I didn't think he could write a book any better and he definitely proved me wrong in the best possible wayI cried like a baby No other author has ever brought me to tearsVery very rarely do I ever laugh out loud from a book and this book had me in stitches I love you John Green
At one moment I could be over joyed with a huge smile in my face and at the next balling my eyes out from pure sadnessactually being able to connect in some ways with 16 year old Hazel the main character even though she was created by a man it still astonishes how perfectly he portrayed her This book is much to good for my words and is much too good for me to want to share it beauty Fantastic Phenomenonal Marvolus
An emotional roller-coaster  Very well done The book was better than the movie
Front cover is creased and corners curl upwards Some wear from shelving present
Great story I saw the movie first I love both anyways Great read great story
Well written book about young adults  Not the typical angst found in this genre
Great Read A few tears for sure but very good story Would love to see the movie
Thought it was inappropriate for young teenagersWas very disappointed
Not great not terrible Dialog was corny the dynamic with her parents was good
Fastest reading novel ever  Saw the movie first and but enjoyed the book as well
Such a sweet book and tearing jerking ending The author told a wonderful story
Great book I bought this for my friend and she said she cried whilst reading it
Absolutely loved this movie Had a twist I never saw coming Be prepared to cry
Love love love this book I'm not usually a fan of YA but this is a must read
A tear-jerker but well told  There's a twist in the story I hadn't seen coming
I thought it was a truly moving story  I couldn't put the book down  Thank you
Be sure to pack some tissues while reading this tear jerker Very well written
Loved this book Witty intelligent banter between main and lovel able characters
Loved this novel Absolutely heartbreaking storyline with enthralling characters

I liked it and a half  Great story will definitely read other John Green works
An easy read for an adult  Thought provoking &amp; quite sad  I really enjoyed it 
Easy read and insight into those who know they will not live a long healthy life
Very touching good short read had to have tissues for the last 20% of the book
Not a big one for contemporary or for cancer books - but John Green won me over
Just amazing  John Green knows how to keep you hooked finish this in one night
Great book Well written and not just for young adults Thanks John Green DFTBA
Lovely story I enjoyed the way Green portrayed the young kids with such insight

I hate to even think of things like cancer So it was with trepidation That I bought this book and read it I am soglad  I did as this is John Green's finest book so farThe Writing was great and I found the characters both sympathetic and I felt that could understand the way thethought of the things that happened to themI am glad that I Read this book and I recommend it to everyone
This novel is just flawless I couldn't put it down The author's use of ideas and phrases so relevant to the average person just blew me away I wanted to write down so many brilliant quotes You become attached to the characters I cried so many times during this book just because the characters meant so much to me even though I read the book in three days It's worth your time It is a positively brilliant novel
A lovely book lovely characters and a spirited way to handle a serious matter
Great book would recommend this book to anyone especially those who like Sparks
Easy read a page turner harrowing in parts great insight into the characters
It was a hard book to keep my interest Ultimately you could predict the ending
Excellent service fast cheap and good book my book look like a new Thanks
Very poignant  I was afraid it would be depressing but it was actually wasn't
I feel like John Green writes for young adults however I really loved this book
This is the Best Book ever fo i have to say more it rocks it is a five star book
Great read Not the happiest of books but well-written with terrific characters
I thoroughly enjoyed this book  I love when a book can make me cry and laugh
The concept of the book was good bit it needed to be longer with a better ending
Loved the tragic yet sweet story  So happy I took a chance to read this grenade
its a lovely story  it wiill bring you into tears cant wait to watch the movie
This is one of the best books I've ever read I literally could not put it down
For whatever reason TFiOS gets a lot of crap but I thoroughly enjoyed the book
I love this book so much and it came in through the mail so fast it was amazing
A moving book written with humor and thoughtfulness so as not to be depressing
Excellent book that you can't put down  It was not at all what I was expecting
Wonderful YA book  Pulls no punches while still being understanding and loving
loved the book love the author loved the movie  That pretty much says it all
Very well written I couldn't put it down Made me laugh out loud several times
I loved it it was a very good book it was one of the best books I have ever read
Powerful Moving Touching Those are the first three words that come to mind when I think about 'The Fault In Our Stars' This book has moved me deeply and I hope that everyone gets to read this book at least once in their lives As a 27 year old that does not have much time to read books I am so glad that this was one that caught my eyeThank you John Green I'll be reading your other books soon :)
I've read all of John Green's books and this is absolutely my favorite so far For what could have been a depressing topic this book made me laugh and smile and I never knew what was going to happen next - and these are characters who are teminally sick I mean you KNOW what will inevitably happen so how did he keep me turning the pages Because he's awesome and this book is amazing and you should totally read it
I almost passed by this book as my family is dealing with cancer  I wasn't sure I could hold back the emotions and tears that so readily come when the C word is mentioned  However the five stars drew me in and I couldn't put it down  The emotions it stirs are raw and acurate  It is a beautiful story that acruately portrays the ups and downs of trying to hold on to hope when hope is really all you have left
This is an exceptional story and one of the best YA books I have ever read  I fell in love with Augustus and Hazel and because the character development was so well done I felt each and every moment of them and their storythey were so believable  I'm a bit embarrassed to admit that (even at 72 years of age) I get great enjoyment from reading YA books John Green will go down as one of my favorite authors
Took a while to get into then it was a wonderful book Better then the movie
Fantastic book But great mistake reading it on the plane Needed more tissues
John Greens writing is smart funny and poignant  This book is no exception
The vocabulary is fantastic The story is sweet and the characters are lovable
A story of strength courage and acceptance in light of serious health issues
daughter recommended --- I have recommended highly - and the movie is as great
Meha bit over dramatic but as always the book was far better than the movie
One of my favorite books Its so touching and humorous I'd totally recommend
It was ok Little tear jerker at times but also gave me a chuckle at times too
Sad but made it real of the feelings that people go through when facing death
How can you not like this book  Its a heart wrenching story you cant put down
I loved it and can't wait to see the movie  Had quite a twist I didn't expect
Loved the book  Had the kids read the book before they went and saw the movie
This book is perfect to put it simply Buy it and read it and never regret It
Considering a book about Cancer patients I thought the book was well written
Great read Definitely puts a different perspective on death illness and will
Good sappy love story about teenagers who do not let their illness define them
Really good the quality and a new and very interesting book Thank you Amazonüôè
Really loved this book I read it in like 3 days I recommend this book to anyone
Such a touching story about star-crossed lovers Brought me to tears
Really enjoyed the book gave me Insight compassion empathy Great Characters
Incredibly believable characters Gut wrenching and beautiful at the same time
A good story not great but good Worth reading once I liked the movie better
it was a sad story but it wasn't only about the dying it was about the living
Great characters and storylineable to visualize and imagine as you read along
Couldn't stop thinking about it when I was not reading it Very emotional read
It's profound It's funny It's insightfully poeticIt's John Green
Beautifully and realistically written Worth getting emotionally involved with
Very emotional book and easy to read but sad I really want to see the movie
Twenty first century version of Love Story Quirky occasionally funny and sad
Great book  Really makes you see what they were going through fighting cancer
If you want some light reading that will make you cry your heart out
As a Boy I have to say this is one of the best books I've ever read a m axing
John Green pulls off the impossible How do you write about a dying teen without pandering or glamorizing He does this and so much moreHis characters are finely drawn and real I especially appreciate that he clearly demonstrates that pain is just pain It does not make one noble or better it just reveals who one is by robbing us of artifice Well written and thought provoking I could not stop reading it
Truly philosophical metaphysical and existential this book will be adored and kept close to those those who are the latter as individuals  Green is an amazing author inviting us into the world of his best work yet showing us both sides of the sword of love cancer friendship parenthood and existence  Buy this book along with Man's Search For Meaning by Viktor Frankl  It will change your life
My favorite thing about this story is how blunt the characters are There are no games in Hazel and Augustus's relationship There was not a hint of cheesiness in their encounters and they are both very unique characters You can't help but fall in love with the both of them It is extremely different from your normal depressing cancer stories I'd recommend this book to anyone and everyone who's open to it
Now I've only given The Fault in our Stars 5 stars because many of my friends have said it's amazing Believe it or not I actually havd not read this book But I look forward to reading it and thank you for your timeInstagram: @omqava @st4rbucksinq @wowavaTumblr: @liqhtninqbuqplease be on the lookout for my next book review my next one will be VERY funnyFOLLOW THE NAMES ABOVE
This is a well-written book full of humor tears and characters so real that I can imagine them walking into my high school classroom tomorrow John Green wrote a cancer book but unlike every other piece of media I've ever seen about cancer the kids in it are not teenaged angels waiting to be reclaimed by God They are real and flawed and scared I highly recommend this book to adults and young adults
This is simply one of the best books I have ever written myself and many others are finding that in one paragraph the writing has the capacity to make laugh with joy then weep with sadness I cannot recommend this book enough if you haven't bought it yet why Well done John Green as the first book of yours I have read it certainly surpassed my expectations Next on my list to buy Look For Alaska :D
Loved the storyline but hated the outcome Great book Also loved the message
It was good for a quick  read I liked the characters and how they played out
Cried cried and cried through out most of this book On the train By myself
It is a really good book  I really recommend this book (for mature teens)
Great book love the story for all ages also great movie and soundtrack
I did not care for the book I had a hard time trying to figure out  the plot
Good read gives you a different perspective on how a cancer patient may feel
I know I'm not a young adult any more but this book got me right in the feels
Arrived promptly no problems as described  Young adults in library love it
Poignant and moving; honest about the ugliness of death and the beauty of love
Absolutely loved this book Makes you wonder whats really important in life
my daughter loved the book arrived in good shape and fast shipping thanks
Amazing read Reminds me of my all time favorite A Walk to Remember
I really liked this book great story I felt that it was a little predictable
I didn't feel emotionally connected to the characters despite their diagnosis
A quick read - my students all loved it so I read it and enjoyed it as well
I have heard that it is a really good book and the people was right I love it
this is the story not to miss Extreamly warm and human despite it is tragic
Great story from perspective of those who are dealing with a terrible illness
This book will stay with me for a long time Heartbreaking realistic and raw
I enjoyed the characters in this book They were well developed and realistic
Very good book well written and fabulous story  Can't wait to see the movie
We'll written My 12year old granddaughter had me read it Sad and victorious
I loved this book I love buying my books on amazon they always come perfect
An easy read that made me laugh and cry The movie was pretty good as well
Great book and easy readgreat story and humor was awesome throughout book
enjoyed this well written story certainly makes you think about your own life
This was such a heartbreaking story one of faith hope and love and strength
Keep my interest but felt I was missing something towards the end  Good read
I fell in love with this book like I fall asleep very fast  &lt;3
It was such a good read  I cried  It ended much differently than I expected
The Fault in our Stars is a beautiful story  Sad but beautiful nonetheless
Funny heartwarming touching heartbreaking An affirmation of a unique kind
Loved the bookI only give 4 stars because I have read lot better books
Really liked the way the story was presented and I am a sucker for a good cry
Great book  Incredible insight and beautifully written  Cried a lot though
Loved it  if you are a girl read it It is romantic in a way I can relate to
Some infinities are bigger than other infinities My father died of cancer three years ago I know Hazel's story isn't the same but still it resonated in me Plus I have a 13-year-old daughter she is healthy but any parent can imagine Thank you Mr Green for sharing this piece of infinity with us but what happened to Hazel's mom and dad or Gus' mom and dad or Anna's mom or the Dutch man  :-)
I love a novel where I'm left thinking This could be a true story this one didn't  Way too much emphasis on a selfish drunk novelist  Not sure if the intent of Mr Green was to leave readers hanging as the characters were or if he just didn't know where to go with this plot  Would a dying child's Wish really be to find out what was the fate of some story characters are Don't think so
Recommended this book to my friends I had read the many 5 star reviews but was still reluctant to read it due to the main characters having cancer  This easily became one of my all time favorite reads  I found myself both chuckling a bit out loud &amp; at times sobbing with emotion I could identify looking at the big picture of life through their eyes and how precious moments are with our loved ones
really great read Finished it pretty fast and cried a little bit at the end
The transaction was only surpassed by the wonderful story in the book itself
Very likeable and funny characters lots of twists and quite a bit of sadness
I did not like this book at all  Book club selection or I would've not read
I'm usually not into romance stuff but this was a great book Very touching
Painful but exquisitely written a great book with a great and meaningful plot
I thoroughly enjoyed reading this book It's absolutely beautiful and honest
This has been so popular to read and so enjoyable by the whole family Thanks
Grab a Kleenex box for this one I never cried so hard reading a book before
I love this book No spoilers hereI just would suggest everyone read this
It was a fantastic book much more than the movie Would recommend to anyone
Amazing book I do reccomend that you read the book before watching the movie
Sensitive and humorous and real and sad and beautiful I recommend it to all
beautifully written  negatively comical relatable and moving and inspiring

Emotional well written tough to handle at times but important book to read
A wonderful well written engaging book  I truly enjoyed reading this book
A great read about a teens perspective on cancer life and romance Loved it
An emotive story full of realism of this terrible disease I liked very much

Young love with a sad ending  The younger readers will appreciate this read
I thought the book was very well written and engaging  I would recommend it
I did enjoy this touching novel although some might find it a bit depressing
read it rather than watched the movie made me cry which was why I ordered it
Great read  Insightful look at how an illness effects one's outlook on life

What an amazing and well written storydefinitely tugs at the heart strings
it was an interesting read from these terminally ill character's perspective
It was an awesome book  I laughed &amp; cried  I would definitely recommend
Liked the book but don't think I would have missed much if I hadn't read it
5 I didn't read it yet but I think it's good  and I can't wait to read it üòç
John Green is honestly the most brilliant writer I started this book 3 days ago and i have about 60 pages yet I know that it's not a proper review until I've finished the book but I have laughed and cried both hysterically I may be an emotional teenage female in a serious relationship but this book has had a definite impact on the way I think I commend John Green on his piece of awesomness
John Green has managed to once again get me to read a book I'm not big on reading and when I do read its either a gruesome process that I'm forced to go through (thanks school) or i sit there and am captured in a whole different world and cannot put the book down All of John's books have done the later for me I can never put his books down until I'm finished and TFIOS is no exception DFTBA
Loved this book It is witty funny emotional and very well written I totally fell in love with Hazel and Augustus and I was rooting for them until the very end The story stirred up alot of emotion inside of me I found myself thinking about them as I drifted off to sleep and also as a first thought when I woke up A wonderful love story with adorable characters Highly recommend reading this
I have been a fan of John Green's ever since the day I picked up Looking for Alaska so I had a good feeling about this book I read it in 4 hours I could not put it down His writing connects with me and keeps me turning the page I wont spoil this book for anyone but i will say it is definitely worth readingI fell in love the way you fall asleep slowly and then all at once
He gave me a good insight to cancer  I very muchliked the characters
This is my middle schooler's favorite book  She can't recommend it enough
Tear-jerker I finished reading in 2 days and I dont Think I stopped crying
Good book Definitely wasn't expecting what happened but still a good story
Excellent writing lovely and sad but gives the reader a lot to think about
Loved it it was sarcastically beautiful in a way I would hope people think
Absolutely wonderful  A beautiful story that provides a lot to think about
Great awesome book I cried in so many parts SO much better than the movie
This book is so popular with teens that there is no way to go wrong with it
Great book Sad without being sappy Makes one think about a lot of things
Interesting perspective on death through the eyes of teenagers  Quick read
Loved the book know don't know if I want to watch the movie very sad ending
A a a a a a a A a a aa a a a a a a a aa a  a a a a a a a aaaa was a  a a ad
Easy read  Very sad  Not overly interesting  Better teen read than adult
An amazing read you just don't want to put it down Isabella - age 11
This was a sad yet entertaining book I could feel the characters emotions
I thought it was a great book  I am now reading another book by John Green
Enjoyable read Probably better suited for teens but nice story Quick read
Liked the book better than the movie but it was still good would recommend
Sweet but very depressing teen romance  Well-written and thought-provoking
The book was very depressing  It didn't appeal to me  It was well written
I expected this to have a little more hope  Sweet love story but very sad
This book is perfectionJohn Green is fantastic and I love  his style
A definite great read Moving Inspiring  and Touching from cover to cover
Hands down one of the best books I've ever read And I'm a 24 year old male
A beautiful story that demonstrates how difficult and beautiful life can be
Great read real page turner looking forward to reading another by John Green
the best book I've ever read 10x better than the movie which was amazing
A very moving book The story was a sad one but had humor courage fantasy
Great book  This was my first book by John Green and I plan to read more
Not the tear jerker I had been promised and knew the ending by about page 12
Tragic story made bearable by the humor of the characters  Quick easy read
Couldn't drop the book Finished that same day I purshed it Simply amazing
Went in the book with a huge load of expectations reading the review from other fellow readers But was disappointed within minutes The whole story revolves around death and cancer which unfortunately is not my type Nothing inspiring or bright on the story line Even the love affair between the hero and heroine is portrayed very poorly  One star given out of sheer sympathy for the author
I was a bit weary about reading a Cancer Book as I am not your typical sentimental   touchy-feely type of girl; however I am glad I did You know a book is good when it evokes emotion and that's exactly what this one did I laughed I cried I felt the butterflies of a good love story and anger at certain characters This is one of those books that you will pass on to everyone you know
John Green's book is an epic and realistic tale of love It is really the most beautifully and tastefully written book that can make you laugh and cry at the same time It has sharp witty humour with loveable characters that take you on an emotional journey through the ups and unfortunately mostly downs of cancer This has to be one of the best books from John Green and is well worth buying
I have read better I have certainly read worse It is a good story captivating but the ending was very disappointing At times it was dull but overall it was a decent story It's not one of those books that you would read a second time 'because it was so good you couldn't put it down' but it was a story that really dug deep and made you think about things I would recommend to others
This novel was fantastic I fell in love with all of the main characters and the way their story unfolded tragedy and triumphs John Green has a true gift when it comes to bringing characters to life and doing them justice by fashioning a beautiful tale I am so emotionally tied to this book both the characters and the story that I can hardly see it as a work of fiction Absolutely grand
great book my daughter 9 yrs old has read it several times &amp; has the movie
Perfect condition My preteen was dying for this book and now she loves it
Awesome book and movie Laughed and cried through out Thanks for the read
Wonderful  heart touching story Book is definitely better than the movie
I really enjoyed this book a mixture of sad moments along side some funny
Good book for teenagers lexile level low enough for middle school as well
great book  I didn't see the movie and don't want to the book was to good
Decent but not as good as I expected being that it received so much hype
Really great quick read  I'm now interested in reading more by John Green
Love this book Sad the movie didn't follow suit Recommended for all ages
A beautiful and well-written story  Teens and adults will enjoy this book
the fault in our stars is not the kind of book I enjoy reading sorry :)
My high schooler read this book for English class and he really enjoyed it
I found it depressing  So much illness and death among these young people
As good as everyone said it was  I enjoyed reading hard for me to put down
This book was so much better than I thought it would be He he j s h s d f
I can see why it was such a hit in YA circles Now I have to see the movie
Bought this for my girlfriend and she's totally in love Came as described
For someone so hopelessly romantic as me this book was my truly my calling
Not that impressed Best for a quick poolside read To each his own I guess
Brilliant dialogue and excellently crafted story and characters  Loved it
The Fault in Our Stars was a touching story; a great read for young adults
Great book Tear jerker for sure Insightful and enlightening perspectives
Enjoyed the show  The actors were quite good and believable in their roles
A poignant realistic well written story about living &amp; dying with cancer
Very beautifully written - sad for sure but touching and uplifting as well
One of the best books I have ever read I have no regrets buying this book
Very good  Well written but it is a tear jerker  Get the tissues ready
Well written Relatively short read Very emotionally intense and poignant
Beautifully written A bit too you adult for my taste but still beautiful
It was goodnot my usual taste in books  Made for a good beach side book
It was interesting and sad - at one point I cried (which comes easy to me)
Beautifully written Emotionally moving I'd highly recommend it to anyone
It was a roller-coaster of emotions  I found it hard to put the book down
Loved this book Very sad  Well written I want to read more of his books
Loved it It's just that simple Funny intelligent and touching storyline
I really enjoyed this book At the library it is in the young adult section but I think it is for everybody - this book was selected as the local town read which tells me that it is for old and young alike  The characters are interesting and I really liked the relationship that developed in the book It is a wonderful story - filled with romance sadness and a very thoughtful ending
Another great John Green book I don't consider myself much of a reader and find myself getting bored while reading But John Green has kept me not only interested in reading two of his books all the way through but wanting me to read them multiple times The Fault in Our Stars is a great book and an easy to follow thought provoking book Definitely recommend it no matter who you are
This book manages to be important and expansive and heart-shatteringly good but also delightfully ordinary It's a small story about one girl and the people in her life and the sickness life has handed to her but it's also so much more This is both John Green at his best and a new and more robust John Green we have not yet met I hope this book means as much to you as it does to me
This was a very sad story but excellently written I am a high school English teacher and after 16 years I believe John Green writes teenagers as well as any author Augustus's development reminds me of Alaska and Margo in Looking for Alaska and Paper Towns respectively I enjoyed the story and the character development If you like John Green or any YA fiction pick this one up
John Green has done it again; his books never cease to amaze me His books are wonderfully and intelligently written The Fault in Our Stars was just amazing I loved that the story was told from a female point of view this time He uses so many literary references in this book and I love that I think that he is a genius and everyone should read this book and all of his books DFTBA
This book is beautiful deep intense emotional and is now my new favorite I've not been a Young Adult for quite some time now However this book touched me on a level no book has been able to reach before I have no words to describe this bookI know this has been quoted numerous times butMy thoughts are stars I can't fathom into constellations
What a great book Makes you think Makes you look at yourself differently
Not as great as everyone makes it out to bemaybe my hopes were too high
Different kind of story with a unique twist I thought it was a good read
Good book I wished it went on to tell what happened to everyone else tho
Great pace in the book rich and vivid characters - very hard to put down
Loved this book It's a great easy read but be prepared -- you will cry
Very sweet (and very sad) Book was well written with engaging characters
loved reading the this book  Watching the movie it reflected on the book
I've read this book twice now and it is one of my all time favorite books
So sad had to finish the book but couldn't bring myself to see the film
De esos libros que quieres seguir leyendo the ending didn't like so much
I loved the book It was sad but it was well written and kept my interest
Quick read couldn't put it down I cried and laughed throughout the book
Amazing thought-provoking sad but ultimately a peaceful book  LOVED IT
Not your typical love story This is a more realistic sad true love story
Loved it Laughed and cried It's is one to read or add to your read list
Heart warming and a 2 box of tissue kinda bookloved every minute of it
Compelling beautifully written quirky and not too overly-sentimental ---
A wonderful story and very quick read Enjoy characters and writing style
It didn't pull me in like I imagined it would but all in all a good read
Such an amazing book Very touching and keeps you turning page after page
Loved it loved it Did not want to see the movie without reading the book
Engaging characters true teen voices Excellent read Keep tissues handy
I loved it  The subject matter was tough but the characters were so warm
Great great great great book that shows heart and love among other things
This book is so tragically beautiful I love it  Definitely worth a read
It was okay  Didn't care for the way it ended  Hope the movie is better
Such a great read Young whimsical emotionalthis book has everything
You laugh a little and cry a little Hoping to see how the movie compares
Great book Hard to stop reading I didn't even realize there was a movie
Best book ever I thought the book was hard cover but it wasn't Oh well
Sad story but it is real life Maybe to complicated for middle school kids
Book club read good perspective from young people with a terminal illness
A beautiful story of young love and heartbreak Wish we could cure cancer
Devoured it in one day  Intelligent sad and funny all at the same time
Funniest most beautiful serious love story ever  Great title  TFIOS 4eva
Nicely written Gives a good perspective from teens suffering with cancer
Not quite up to the hype but worth the audiobookQuite natural read
Very intriguing characters faced with an incredibly challenging situation
Yay it's good I love it so much I love nessy I cry a lot yeah so do you ya
The Fault in Our Stars is easily the most beautiful well-written novel I've read in a long time This book had me laughing out loud at times with its character's witty humor Other times It had me crying along with the characters John Green is truly at his best here He allows you to glimpse into the lives of those who have little time left I highly recommend reading this book
This is was the first JG book I've ever read and let me tell you I LOVE his style of writing Is any of it realistic No But it's a fictional novel so it's okay It's mean to be a bit of an escapist novel and I love it My fifteen-year-old self would have drooled over Augustus and mourned the lack of real-life Guses in the world Brilliant book and I can't wait to read more
ive read all of john greens books and im a huge fan i love this book its not your typical cancer book if you know what i mean the plot was different that what was expected but i wont say and be a spoiler its a beautiful book and i encourage you to read it my copy was signed and its something ill treasure for a very long time i wish all of my john green books were signed
Very sweet book  Probably meant for a younger audience but I enjoyed it
John Green is a cool guy but his books are the scourge of our generation
Almost as good as Paper Towns A must read for anyone affected by cancer
One of the best books I've read Would recommend this book to my friends
I cried so hard but it was just such a good book A breath of fresh air
Word of warning: Do not read this book in public May induce ugly crying
One of the best but definitely the saddest books I've read in a long time
This book was horrible - depressing and confusing - don't wyes your time
Wonderful interesting book that my 15-year old grandson truly enjoyed 
I am not the target market for this book I liked it but did not love it
I bought it for my teenage daughter who hates to read and she loved it
this remarkable story of the courage of young people dealing with cancer
Just one star  did not like this story at all   Not a good read for me
Who watches a movie or reads a book that always drives one to depression
Read it after I saw the movie and got a little more insight  Enjoyed it
Great read can't wait to see movie (although I know they never compare )
I suppose it was to some interesting but not something I enjoyed reading
I loved this book I just didn't like the ending But I was expecting it
I enjoyed the book until the 3/4th into it and then it became predictable
Sweet poignant witty from the eye of a cancer victim  Very good read
Really enjoyed the book it was an easy read while relaxing on the beach
Pretty good book Not something I just couldn't put down but a good story
Turned on the waterworks but well worth the read Finished it in 3 days
daughters loved this bookI think that they each read it in a day each
This was an amazing read Cried and laughed all the way through the book
Was expecting something grand with over 20000 reviewsnever happened
The most amazing book I have ever read This was the perfect love story ‚ù§
This was a good book I read through it too fast I couldn't put it down
I enjoyed it even though it was heartbreaking it was also heart warming
Loved this book As a cancer survivor I can appreciate some of the humor
This is possibly the best book I have ever read in my life It is certainly not just a cancer kid book It is so much more than that It talks to your soul (I know that sounds weird but don't let my ineptitude with words stop you from reading this wonderful book) and takes your heart on a journey that you have never been on before I highly recommend this book to everyone
This is one of those books that make you feel so attached to the characters that you miss them when it's over I find myself wanting to re-read it to reconnect with them This is a wonderful book- not at all what I expected from a book about a bunch of kids with cancer The characters the storyline and the writing are terrific I laughed I cried I loved every bit of it
This book has been on my to read list for a while One of my friends recommend it to be but I didn't think much of it THENI started to read it My opinion about the book totally changed after the first chapter It's probably the best book I have ever read The book is so interesting and intense It's a great romance book and I defiantly think everyone should read it
This book was highly recommended to me by a relative While it is clearly a young adult book and I am an adult I enjoyed most of it and looked forward to reading it until it was finished The most important thing is it made me laugh cry and think about life and death in a very good way I will pass this on to my 15 year old and never forget the characters in the book
I've ready all of John's books and I didn't think I'd ever love anything more than Alaska and Abundance But this was sooooo good I won't go on and on about his absolutely great writing style and his crafting of characters Green's craft is so well put together and this book is his best yet I read this book in one day I was sad to have to finish it Great great great
The Fault In Our Stars is the best book I have read in many years It is an amazing novel that will forever be a classic to me and many others I received my copy as a gift and wasn't sure what I would think of it but at the first page I was instantly sucked into the world of Hazel Grace I think everyone should get a chance to enjoy the inspirational novel by John Green
I thought this book was really excellent I don't want any spoilers so I'll just say that this book was really moving and thoughtful and that it is not just a book for teenagers but for all ages (seeing as I'm not a teenager myself) This is my second John Green book and he continues to prove that he has a real mastering of the english language and the human condition
Tragedy porn Couldn't get into the charachters Didn't feel believable
I loved the writing the acting/reading the words everything about it
I am glad I saw the movie because the book just didn't hold my interest
This was a super quick read with the right touch of angst and sweetness
Predictable Typical teen fiction I think it was hyped up WAY too much
Don't read this without a box of tissues  Great read Highly recommend
Boring boring boring I only finished reading out because I paid for it
Couldn't put it down Tears and laughter all in the same book Loved it
My teen Daughter read this book she had nothing but great thing to say
Good story and perspective I Understand why this is a young adult book
Pretty engaging  Somewhat unrealistic dialogue Good need to cry movie
Amazing book Touches you where your heart is But it is a tissue alert
I just love this book Quick easy read that evokes some serious emotion
Half the book is great the second half really struggled to be realistic
Loved it very emotional and touching Quite a bit of heroism thrown in
I really enjoyed this book haven't seen the movie yet but I want to now
Loved this book but now I am not sure if I want to watch the movie now
A page turner a year jerker and a very beautiful story about young love
A truly moving book as always the book is 1000x better than the movie
No wordsexcept read it Cry and cry some more

Very sad subject but very well written  I thoroughly enjoyed this book
Absolute smashing storybeautifully writtencan't wait Ty see the movie
Good insight into what young people with terminal cancer may be thinking
I read this book in just over a day Loved it Definitely a tear jerker
It was to predictable and needed a bigger problem but was okay OKAY :)
Awesome Tough topic treated with great sensibility humor and realism
Written for a younger audience but a great read for this 50 plus reader
Beautiful story Read it in under 24 hours and I am re-reading it now
Perfect  I bet my kids will be required to read this in school one day
This was such a great book and will keep you turning the pages 10/10 (:
Good teenager coming of age book with the twist of terminal cancer doom
Despite being a tear-jerker this was an amazing book John Green nailed the narrator's voice perfectly (as well as the other characters' voices) At times I wanted to put the book down because I knew what was coming but I couldn't Read the whole thing in one sitting (and yes cried a lot) One of the best books I've read in a whilefunny sad poignant hopeful
I saw the trailer it looked so good that I immediately wanted to read this book it's veryvery well written heart-warming and sad I bawled my eyes out at the end and I usually don't cry during movies or books it was a page Turner quick read I read the whole book in three hours total this is DEFINITELY my new favourite book I recommend to everyone all ages
Wisdom incredible insight humor sex deep sympathy skill concern with a capital C: this author 'wrote' all those things Hazel and Augustus live with meI can't say when this has happened before but I am glad it hasnow  They are great kidsNO way this book shdjust be listed in YA It is a book for the agesall ages that is over about ten
Simply put a beautiful heartbreaking hilarious emotional story This is by far one of the best books I've read in the past year I ended up crying myself to sleep over Green's characters who are so so real and who really bring a difficult topic - cancer in children - to life Hazel and Augustus are both extremely believable characters Definitely worth a read
This book is brilliant On so many levels It makes you understand the depression the agony the unexpected that can happen while people so young deal with something so tragic I wish I could erase my memory just so I could experience falling in love with this book all over again John Green you never cease to amaze me Keep writing my friend for all of our sake
How can one rate the ability of an author their description the flow of their paragraphsHere John Green proves his ability to not only wow the targeted teen audience but also intrigue a wider variety of age demographics his storytelling is flawless his character definition was perfect and not one moment was spent re-reading the story in confusion
I've been having a John Green obsession and so far I read Will Grayson Will Grayson Paper Towns Looking For Alaska and this marvelous book This book is one of my favorites I love it Because it's filled with cute romantic moments I love the connection between Hazel and Augustus When I finished it I couldn't stop thinking about it It was just that amazing
The most inspirational teen novel so far John Green you are BRILLIANT
I read it on my tablet  good story  sad too  Good Movie at times sad
Very moving and thoughtful  I hope they didn't ruin it with the Movie
A very good book especially if you are in for a real tear jerking story

Insiteful humorous tear jerking The kind of book you don't put down

Intelligent teens with terminal cancer surprisingly an enjoyable read
This book is so touching you can feel emotion pouring out of its pagesI laughed and cried and it felt so real like I was watching it for real in real lifeI really recomend this book it has every quality in every genre love death hope It amazes me that a man in his thirties can describe and create a sixteen-year-old so wellPlease read
My book arrived before the estimated delivery date and in perfect conditionThis is my absolute favorite of John Green's books A tearjerker yes but incredibly heartfelt and the characters are realReally a wonderful wonderful book and I recommend it to everyone Don't let the fact that it is a young adult novel deter you from picking it up
iv`e never read a book that has affected me so much Emotionally brutal physically sick completely in awe of Green and how this book has a pulse A lot of what i felt about my illness is ingrained in the pages i cried until i couldn`t anymore Every page is tear stained Beautifully written and every character has resonated with me long after the last page
I can't tell you how much I loved this book My eyes are all red from crying and I can't stop hugging my baby daughter Green's writing is stellar the characters feel real and the questions brought up in the novel are thoughtful This is the first time I've written a review for Amazon and it's for good reason--this book will change your life Get reading
Simply amazing Love the touch of humor Got me on some of the twists
I actually liked the movie more than the book but still a good read
Great book It shipped fast and was a great buy I would recommend it
Didn't keep my attention as much as I thought Very sweet story though
Arrived two days earlier Very well packaged I am very happy with it
Enjoyed the story Did not end as I thought Anxious to see movie now
I loved this book It was better than the movie which most books are
Really enjoyed this story Glad I read the book before I see the movie
This was a great read a tear or two was shed Must see the movie now
Don't miss this book Read it in a day because I couldn't put it down
Probably the only time I felt like the movie was better than the book
I loved every word in this book cover to cover Absolutely incredible
Predictable but a very moving storyNicely written - easy reading
Good insight to some aspects of cancer Well written an amazing story
Excellent storyso well written Would highly recommend this book
This is a good read  Passed it on to my granddaughter who loved it
Thought it was more suitable for my teenage granddaughter than myself
Beautiful story but if a tear jerker in parts but overall a good read
Had a twist made me upset Was a good story line Did keep me reading
Great book Will recommend to anyone who wants to know about the book
While the synopsis of the story initially sounds like a bad lifetime movie the book caught my attention from start to finish The heroine was a pleasure to spend time with and she remains irreverent witty and clear-eyed while confronting her own demise I tried reading this as slow as I could because I realized it's one of those books that come by rarely
The Fault in our Stars is a beautifully written emotional roller coaster book one page I was laughing the next one I was crying  and not a couple of tears crying my eyes out Not that I like to cry a lot while reading but this is an Amazing story of life death and love  It definitely give you a perspective  I love this book and I really recommend it
Although fiction I was given a better insight to the hearts of our teenagers not just in illness but in their everyday struggles and how parents try as we may often have no clue It made me take a look at children cancer and life itself in a new way The Fault In Our Stars is poignant bold funny creativeI am compelled to read it again and again
This book is just that good Once I started reading I could not put it down again until the book was finishedHard to put into words exactly what it is that is so enthralling - the author's voice the great characters the awareness and rejection of the inherent cheesiness of the sick kid genre - it's all great stuffRead this book
I think the book perfectly described the coming to life of all the characters I lived the plot and I don't expect what happen near the end The characters were funny and interesting The beginning of the book was intriguing and had me addicted and I could not put the book down I loved every part of it I highly recommend this book to anyone at any age
This book draws you in with its love tragity hope and of course its hummer Although cancer is always present MrGreen has found a way to distract educate and inspire me as a reader teenager and daughter of a cancer surviver Thank you MrGreen ps sorry about the abominal spellin in my defense im severaly dislexic and there is no spell check
The Fault in Our Stars is a book out of the mainstream  At times it has humor but a lot of real-time life pathos It is well written and opened my mind to a current profound issue This was our book club book; one I will never forget In our discussion we all liked the characters and we all agreed it was a great choice This book is good for a book club
I loved this book and I lent it to my sister and my mother  My sister said she liked it also btut thought that the title was horrible and likely would not have picked up the book based on the title  Once she said that l realized I couldn't remember the name of the book only the author's name so I would have to agree the title is probably not a great one
All I have to say is that after reading this book I am emotionally broken in the best way possible I read this book cover to cover only pausing when I couldn't see through my tears This is a must read and definitely not just for young adults This is a beautifully tragic piece of literature that I plan to reread just as soon as I can compose myself
We all know the movie made money once you read the book you know why
Very well written Although the story was sad it was very uplifting
At times sad at times happy Makes you realize how precious life is
Wonderful heartfelt story  Quick read but have your Kleenex handy
Such a beautiful story I would recommend to anyone to get this book
Couldn't put it down Loved the bookcan't wait to watch the movie
My 12 year old grandson recommended this book to me  Thank you son
Very easy read and a story for all ages--but get your tissues ready
Heart wrenching and heart warming Awesome life story and love story
Amazing read Really makes you remember the important things in life
A good novel to understand death of the young and how they handle it
Oh my god this made me cry so so so so so so so so so so good and sad
Absolutely great book  There is no better YA novel around right now
John Green sits at up at night bathing in the tears of his readers
A really good book  Only took one day to read could not put it down

This book was wonderfully written and also one of the most moving books i've ever read Aside from the beautiful words the story was en-capturing insightful and thought-provoking I would recommend this book to anyone with a soul heck anyone without one might develop one after they read this book Kudos to John Green for producing another great book

When a book can make you cry that is some good writing right there
Couldn't put it down My daughter has read it 4+ times A must read
Wow Loved this book I can't say enough how much I loved this book
Couldn't put this book down  Deffently had some tearful moments
I have to consider the audience it was intended for and it wasn't me
Well written One of the best love stories I've read in a long time
I love the book could not stop reading it even way past my bedtime
Great book well wrote Will make you cry at parts but very touching
I enjoyed the characters Of course you know its sad but up lifting
It was a great book I loved how it ended Definitely a tear jerked
Very well written It's one of those books that are hard to put down
First read by author John Green and very impressed with his writing
Fantastically written and completely different from what I expected
The Magic Mountain it ain't Neither is it Franz Kafka dying of TB while being nursed by Dora Dymont but that said Augustus and Hazel will break your heart anywayThere are technical faults in the story the supporting characters are thinner than Kate Moss but it's entirely worth it I've spent time in Amsterdam and he captures it wonderfullyHave not seen the film yet but the book is a pleasure You think the dialog is trying too hard to be cute and smart (and it is) but you get sucked in anywayRead it and weep
The first thing to say probably is that this is one of those ‚ÄúIts not you its me‚Äù moments in my reading life because John Green writes well So theres thatBut this one wasnt really for me when it got down to the nitty gritty Despite the emotional resonance that should be present when reading a story about cancer sufferers especially young people I didnt really connect here at all I kept trying but it never really tookIt went on a bit in places there were points when I felt that Mr Green was simply trying to put beautiful words on the page for the sake of it At times it all felt a bit ‚Äúoh I‚Äôll make the reader cry here but here‚Äôs a bit of humour for you‚Äù by numbers rather than letting the story flow organicallyBy the time I hit the last third of this book I was ready for it to be overdespite some moments where I could see the potential (when one of the characters was deteriorating in health and mind) by that time I really couldnt bring myself to care much about it I kind of feel guilty for thatThe main problem for me is I read a lot Including a lot of Young Adult fiction of many kinds And whilst I can see why this is so popular and wonder if I would have been more into it if I‚Äôd read it when I was younger I just didnt think it was THAT good When it comes to writing emotionally compelling young characters caught up in situations that elicit a huge heartfelt response from me Patrick Ness and Courtney Summers do it better By quite a wide marginIt obviously hits the mark with a LOT of readers though So for that reason I would still recommend that you read it for yourself In this case I seem to be a minority opinion But hey when it comes to reading we love what we love Its just the way it is**Borrowed from my daughter who incidentally adores this book***Happy Reading Folks
I know it's sacrilegious to admit this in the wake of the many rave reviews this book has received but I did NOT cry when I read it Although I did find several scenes very touching and some of the writing beautiful in the end I didn't cry because I felt the author was trying way too hard to make me do exactly thatOK here's a book about teenagers with cancer who fall in love Are you crying yet No (spoiler alert) How about if one of them has a relapse Are you crying NOW OK how about if I knock one of them off and have him leave a maudlin love letter behindThe whole premise of teenagers dying of cancer when they've just fallen in love is already inherently heartbreaking But it was as if the author wanted to keep piling on the emotion just to make us cry which is the classic definition of a tear-jerker(I don't usually read young adult novels so I had no idea who John Green was when a friend insisted I read this book and wasn't familiar with his reputation or any of his previous books Just so you know I was reading this with a totally objective mind)I also thought the main characters' dialog was pretty implausible (no normal teenager talks like that; or is the author saying that this is an exclusive trait of teenagers with terminal cancer) Besides the whole topic of young lovers being parted due to cancer has been done so many times already starting with Love Story back in 1970 Although this book has its merits and there are plenty of people who will love it I just couldn't respond to the deliberate emotional manipulation
I was eager to finally have the opportunity to read ‚ÄúThe Fault in Our Stars‚Äù by John Green being that I have enjoyed many of his other novels This book had a lot to live up to considering that I had heard numerous positive reviews Indeed I took pleasure in reading such a heroic love story; however I was disappointed in how the plot and characters developed In the story Hazel Grace Lancaster is a very mature and sophisticated sixteen year old who is battling a terminal case of thyroid cancer One day she meets Augustus Waters otherwise known as Gus who has lost his leg due to bone tumors Throughout the book they grow as people and flourish together as they become two star-crossed lovers In fact Gus makes his one ‚Äúwish‚Äù that he has granted to him for the sake of Hazel Her dream which becomes a reality is to meet her favorite author This part although touching was quite predictable They travel to Amsterdam only to be disappointed by Hazel‚Äôs idol At first the two were upset and despondent Yet together they make the best out of their situation and enjoy Amsterdam and each other‚Äôs company Even though traveling to Europe with minimal supervision may sound like a dream come true to most teenagers I kept going back to one thought while reading this book Could any of this actually happen in real life Is it possible that a mother would ever leave her dying daughter to meet a strange man and walk around in a foreign country alone Answering my own question I concluded that no it is not a realistic plot for two young adults  Another problem I came across while reading ‚ÄúThe Fault in Our Stars‚Äù is the intricate language used and general knowledge known by Gus and Hazel As a teenager myself I find it hard to believe that the characters are real life people Because of this I cannot relate to anything that they do or say Additionally such a perfect relationship like that of Gus and Hazel at such a young age is unattainable One could argue that cancer forces kids to grow up quicker than most; however I do not believe that even adults could possibly act as mature as Hazel and Gus did in situations presented in this book  Nevertheless the way John Green writes is simply magnificent His sentence structure and word choice makes the book come alive in ways that many authors cannot achieve Credit must be given to Green in making a book about two dying children somehow happy and hopeful The theme of courage is consistent throughout the entire novel and inspires people to live life to the fullest Even though the characters may seem a bit unrealistic I could not help to form a bond with the characters and care about their own wellbeing I did become teary-eyed when Augustus passed away proving that John Green had done his job of creating a story that provokes emotions in every day teens Because of this despite the flaws that I found in ‚ÄúThe Fault in Our Stars‚Äù I would still recommend this captivating love story to others
This book didn't meet my expectations at all I was hoping it would be a book my older grand daughter might like to read but I would be very uncomfortable with that considering the language and some of the situations
This book is exceptionally well written  John Green put a lot of thought into the way his characters interacted in this masterpiece  Even after reading this four times I still catch myself thinking about Hazel Grace and end up reading it again in the usual overnight manner  I am seventeen and I recommended this book to my 50+ year old boss  She absolutely adored it as well  This book is a great self find book I learned just how fortunate I am with the turn of every page  I recommend this to people of every gender and age
The book was somewhat depressing overall and  perhaps I am old  fashioned but why does a book with a target audience of 14 condone sex Reading about teens talking &amp; thinking about sex is ok but doing it I preferred the movie which portrayed the teens as beyond high schoolIn spite of my better judgement I gave a copy to my granddaughter who loved it as did her siblings She asked me to send her all of  the author's books which I didObviously In spite of a career in secondary education I am out of touch  with adolescent literature
I'm not a teenager; I'm not a weeper; I scorn attempts to play on my emotions by books / movies / tv shows I knew how this book would end after the first few pages Why then did I end up crying for the last 200 pages of this book Probably because John Green made me care more about the characters than their disease No one close to me (and certainly no children) has died of cancer so I wasn't identifying with the trials of a horrible debilitating illness BUT I do remember the intensity of first love and I can imagine having the specter of imminent death hanging over you - as opposed to the illusion of invincibility that most young people haveHazel and Augustus do seem more verbal and thoughtful than most people their age but then they have been through more than most people of any age I understand Hazel retreating into the world of a favorite book and wanting to know what HAPPENS after after the ending - isn't that a metaphor for her abbreviated lifeI heard good things about this book but like a lot of people I was put off when I heard about the subject matter - kids with cancer no thanks Unfortunately the fact that it is classed as Young Adult will also put off many older people - and it shouldn't This is a book for anyone over the age of 14 or so who loves sharp dialogue and heartbreakingly real characters And the the catharsis of a good cry
This book will stick with you long after you finish reading it Absolute perfection CANNOT wait to see the movie
I must admit that I was a little put off at first when I initially learned about the plots  Reading about Gus and Hazel makes my heart smiles and often forget that Gus is only 17  It is a very powerful story and very emotional  I could barely get through the last few chapters because I was a sobbing crying fool  I enjoyed the humors the love story between Gus and Hazel and the strength that held their family together through this rough time  I would recommend this book great read and you will fly through it rather quicklyCheers
As a 13 year old boy who has a higher than average reading level it is hard to find challenging books this book was an excellent challenge I learned words that I would not expect to find in vocabulary work book let alone a teen novel This goes above and beyond what I ever imagined
I read this for book club I would have never picked this up on my own but I'm glad I read it  Most of the reviews for The Fault In Our Starts are so very complimentary that I really wanted fall in love with this book like everyone else did  Don't get me wrong it's not bad nor is it boring The book is good It's actually pretty good but I seriously missed what was so mesmerizing that mostly everyone else seemed to loved it to piecesYes the story is sad having cancer is sad The only thing more sad about having cancer is a child or teenager with cancer Especially terminal cancer And that's what this book is aboutI felt so bad for the teenagers in the book The whole story from beginning to end seemed like none of them could catch a break I found a few slivers of laughter here and there when Gus or Hazel said or did something sort of funny Even their friend from the support group was so adorable I almost felt the most bad for him because he was so heart broken by the little girl breaking up with him When I stopped to think about how a teenager would react to certain situations this book made total senseI could even feel the parents pain about their child being terminally ill  Seeing how it such a painful and unfortunate situation affected different families and marriages was also intriguingAgain this book was good so I recommend it I just didn't fawn all over it like most everyone else
This book is unusually honest thought-provoking and moving At first the love element reminded me of Twilight but this book is far too intelligent and eloquent to sustain that comparisonHelpfully it gives insight into how teen cancer patients might think and feel (It's not always sanctified)This book is particularly transparent in its (existential) worldview and baldly confronts questions of life death and eternity The Christianity Hazel encounters seems to be an anemic superficial collection of catchphrases: Living your best life now Hazel treats it as an indulgent irrelevant sentimentality and it's no wonder Much like Solomon at certain points in his Ecclesiastes she rages rages against the dying of the light in a finite meaningless universe and she needs solid meaningWhen reading this book I sometimes wished Hazel could see a robust picture of the God of the Bible the God Who rules over the mystery and misery The God Who knows suffering better than any other the God Who took on the cancer of my sin: the crucified God The God Who makes all things new She hears echoes of Him in the goodness of creation and in the love of Gus and her family But in her zero-g world these can never bring the ultimate gravity she needs--By the way the audiobook performance is amazing--perhaps even better than reading the physical book
This will be a bit hard to explain without spoilers but I'll do my bestMaybe I was expecting too much from this book with all the 4-5 star reviews and comments from everyone but I did not like it At first I must admit I was really hooked but torwards the middle and end of the book there are story lines that I think should have been explored deeper or at least make them more significant Even when Hazel has an important revelation by the dutch writer her reaction was whatmaybe a paragraph I feel like the author didn't deliver And it's not that the book is mainly for teens and I'm 26 because I still cry every time I read Bridge to Terabithia the book simply caused no emotions in me and it's a real shame becaue the characters are likeable but all the details and events of the book are vaguely portrayedSome chapters start with random information the author uses to make a point that turns out really isn't that important (Maslow hierarchyreally)  I think teenagers are perfectly capable of exploring deeper darker emotions and situations in a book and if the Fault In Our Stars had done this it would have been truely amazing
I think I may have gone in to this book with expectations that were a bit too high Afterall look at it's Amazon ratings Admittedly I was a bit hesitant about jumping into it after I read the synopsis (cancer books aren't really my thing) but after skimming through some of the reviews I deduced that there must be more to this book than kids dealing with cancer However The Fault in Our Stars seemed like a more realistic and less poetic version of a depressing Nicholas Sparks novelNow don't get me wrong it was [bitter]sweet and I really liked the main characters but something was just off and I think that may be attributable to John Green's writing style I haven't read anything else by JG but I couldn't get to a place where I felt anything more than sympathy for the unfortunate Cancer Kids--which is exactly what they didn't want I couldn't feel Hazel and Gus' pain I could only watch from the outside and feel horrible for them I couldn't become Hazel in my mind put myself in her shoes and hurt as she hurt I was only allowed to peer in and then feel guilty that I didn't have cancer and therefore couldn't really understand the feeling of having numbered days left in this lifeUltimately I just never saw how this book was about anything more than kids that had fault in their stars (aka cancer) I did shed tears during certain pivotal moments and I absolutely loved Augustus Waters who made me laugh out loud several times I did get a bit bored whenever he and Hazel launched into discussions on existential realities and the like but I did enjoy their exchanges on bigger infinities Also the significance of the word okay resonated deeply with me It was a decent if not somber read but I think I'll stick to non-cancer books from now onOh and why didn't we get to read Augustus's sequel to AIA and find out what happened to Anna's mom and the Dutch Tulip Man
'The Fault in Our Stars' has not made it onto many Young Adult 'must read' lists for no reason It's well-written and Green provides a compelling emotional story While this novel deals with rather 'heavy' subject matter it is presented in a way that teens can handle The protagonist (Hazel) is relatable to many teens not only because of her age Obvious parallels can be drawn between readers who have or have been effected by serious illnesses However many teens who have not been effected by cancer can connect with her as well While there are scenes depicting sexuality they are mild enough for most teens to read I would recommend this novel for those in  high school Many students in 7th or 8th grade would be able to handle this novel and I am confident that the reading level is appropriate for middle school However some students may not appreciate or understand much of what is happening in Hazel's head Green's novel could be used as a vehicle to teach most of the goals in the new Common Core 'The Fault in Our Stars' could be incorporated into a unit about dynamic characters questioning society and many others It would be interesting to plan a cross-curricular lesson with a science/biology teacher for this novel Students could use the novel as a nonfiction reference while learning about different kinds of cancer 'The Fault in Our Stars' is a quick read and most young students would find it interesting It has contemporary allusions that may help students connect to the material It also contains multiple themes that are fairly universal (young love loss/death) and it provides small moments for cross-curricular connections (biology social studies) The main drawback for this text would be the emotional weight of the story The cancer and loss could be a a connector for many students but it would not be far fetched for a student to be 'too emotional' and become uncomfortable reading (of course pushing boundaries of comfort can be good within reason) You could meet some resistance as this book is fairly new it is at an easier reading level (although it deals with difficult subject matter) and it's not part of an established canon Overall I think this would be a wonderful book to teach with upper levels of Junior High and lower levels of High School
John Green's The Fault in our Stars is a great young adult novel for lessons on love loss and suffering  Hazel Augustus and Isaac are in some ways typical teenagers who experience their first loves fights and breakups and therefore are relatable to the young adult audience  However their medical conditions make them unique and give them different perspectives on the world and their relationships with both family and friends  Hazel's fear of building relationships because of the hurt that she might cause is something that can reach young readers who are afraid to open up in their own relationships for various reasons  When Hazel does open up she is eventually hurt and that is a reality of life  The important message to take away is that Hazel does not regret her time with Augustus and wish that she had not been hurt  Instead it teaches a lesson about appreciating what you can have and handling disappointment and loss The themes in Green's novel can certainly be taught to a whole class focusing on relationships with family and friends the fear of hurting a loved one and handling loss  I think a message about appreciating and experiencing life with the time you have is incredibly important to any teen audience  However it is also a good book to keep as an independent read for students who might be going through more similar situations to the characters  For a student who is either diagnosed him/herself or has a loved one who is ill or dying Green's novel provides characters who are also suffering and let their guards down  It can show students that it is okay to falter from the strong fighter that Hazel describes as the typical cancer patient  It is impossible for me to know how any terminally ill person is feeling but Hazel Augustus and Isaac could very well be for someone what Anna in An Imperial Affliction was for Hazel The only cautions for using this book in a classroom setting would be some of the language and the sexual scene in Amsterdam but these elements are important to the story  The language shows the emotions that a sixteen-year-old experiences especially in their situations in a more authentic way  The sexual scene in Amsterdam and the discussion of it both earlier in the novel and after it happens show the reader Hazel and Augustus's desire to experience a full life in the short time that they know they have  That being said I think The Fault in Our Stars would be best used with students in grades 10 to 12  These students will find the life experiences that the characters have more relatable and the content more age appropriate
I was hesitant to read this book due to it's dark nature but after seeing the great reviews I decided to go for it I was hoping to be pleasantly surprised but I was not I even bought this book as a gift  for someone before I read it Oops- now I have to explain why I'm giving such a depressing story as a gift
I can't even begin to explain how just a few short hours ago I was a different person I was completely engrossed in this book from the moment I began reading I literally could not put it downThe story is sad that's a given just by reading the other reviews But the story is a complete paradigm shifter it has changed the way I view my own unremarkable existenceGreen's writing is beautiful and well crafted This book reaches a depth of emotion most authors can only aspire toWell done Mr Green well done
Okay so now that I finished this book I've read some negative reviews that kind of irk me People say that these teenagers are unrealistic and hard to believe I am a 16 year old girl and this is completely true I have never (and probably will never) met/meet teenagers like Hazel Augustus and/or Issac Their wit and overall amazing-ness astound me Like seriously an attractive star basketball player who loves to read &amp; has great humour But that's why I love this book I mean if I wanted some real teenage dialogue why would I be reading I like that I can be taken away on a journey via reading--away from reality you know The only downfall is that it makes reality depressing I guess And I like learning SAT vocab words through books How else am I going to remember them With that said I am still a 16-year-old girl so I feel like some of these concepts are above me I need to re-read this especially when I get older (I have not experienced a person close to me dying before I am glad about this fact though)DFTBA
I'm not so sure about this one The story is appropriately sad but that's about it It just makes you feel sad In that way I feel this book is kind of emotionally manipulative The author also seems to think he is a better writer than he is which creates a strangely pretentious work The characters are also ridiculously unrealistic and the book glamorizes cancer It's not horrible but for all the hype it isn't worth it
Before this book I'd read another John Green book Looking for Alaska that everyone seemed to adore but left me feeling cold So when I started seeing stellar reviews for this book I was a bit skeptical that it would entrance me as much as everyone else Still way too many bloggers that I trusted absolutely raved about how amazing and uplifting and funny and sad this book was that I felt I had to give it a chance So I did (And I stayed up way too late last night finishing it) As I wiped away my tears and hit the sack it occurred to me that the perfect way to review this book would be to capture my feelings about it as the five stages of grief (Very apropos given that the subject of the book is teenagers with cancer) So before I forget this brilliant middle of the night inspiration I'm writing my review the day after finishing the book (which is pretty much unprecedented for me as I still have reviews to write for books I read in APRIL)Stage 1: Denial (before starting the book): This book can't possibly be as good as everyone says it is How can a book about teens with cancer be funny and uplifting yet also heart-breaking And a YA book that really moves me Bah humbug I'm too old for these YA books They disappoint me more often than notStage 2: Anger (within the first five chapters): Damn it This book is brilliant I'm loving Hazel Grace and Augustus Waters and their witty repartee and view of life Why did I wait so long to read this Why did I delay Why didn't I listen What if I'd decided to chump out and not read this and MISSED IT Arggghhhyou stupid foolStage 3: Bargaining (about the middle of the book): I don't want this book to end I want to stay with these characters longer If I slow down my reading pace I can spread the delight of this book out over a few days Maybe if I start another book this book will never end and I'll get to read it for days and daysStage 4: Depression (at about the three-quarter mark until the end): I can barely read through my tears and my smiles I'm having my heart broken by this author over and over Such emotion and pain and laughter and feelings of truth and beauty Each page takes me closer to the end of this amazing gem of a book and I don't want that to happenStage 5: Acceptance (now): Everyone was right The Fault In Our Stars is a truly special book that transcends the YA genre and speaks to the human heart It is fierce and funny and unapologetic and realistic and it broke my heart in the best of ways A true five-star read and one I'm grateful to have read Thank you John Green I bow before you in your brilliance You're no Peter Van Houten
I read this book in less than 24 hours and while I'm not a crier (and I am a woman) this book did make me get that blasted lump in my throat but not until the very endI loved the sarcasm and wit that came from all the teenagers  It made them realLoved it
This book was in the teen reader section of the bookstore and I picked it out for one of my children I ended up reading it myself -- in one evening What the book has: Writing like this: There are a number of ways to establish someone's approximate survival expectations without actually *asking* I used the classic: 'So are you in school' Generally your parents pull you out of school at some point if they expect you to bite itAlso metaphors The book also has metaphors The metaphors do bother some people and they are sometimes heavy-handed but they are always playful and so you don't care For example the fact that Gus and Hazel go to Holland is a metaphor -- I'm guessing There is an old essay written by a mother of special needs children that talks about how parenthood is supposed to be like going to Italy You get all ramped up about going to Italy -- the sights the food the experience Everyone else goes to Italy too But when you get off the plane you find that you did not land in Italy you landed in Holland And you can't get to Italy you have to stay in Holland Raising children with special needs puts you in another country an unexpected country the essay goes -- not a horrible country just a different one The point of the essay is that you learn that there are great things about Holland too even if you don't make it to ItalyI'm presuming that John Green read the essay and that these cancer sufferers are also in Holland while the healthy kids get to live in Italy The book is full of metaphor and the book-within-the-book subplot is part of it sure but also makes the book more interestingWhat else the book has The book has real parents I mean as characters They say witty things This is a refreshing change from books where the parents are clueless dolts at worst and invisible at bestWhat the book does not have: Any real apparent consequences of actually suffering from cancer You know that the characters have cancer because the book says so You know that the characters are dealing with the fact that they could die I'm grateful that there is no Brave Cancer Sufferer here but instead of offering up a different reality Green sort of just mostly avoids the one we all just can't stand Doesn't the medication have any side effects Doesn't the prosthetic itch Doesn't lung cancer cause wheezing coughing (up blood) chest pain Hazel has lungs that do a terrible job of being lungs -- can there be a more terrifying feeling than that of suffocating Probably but you have to go rent the movie Saw to find out The regular experience of that kind of trauma should leave some sort of footprint Hazel is a teenager -- in a wonderful place What happens when she misjudges her stamina and finds herself gasping for breath While as a reader I'm desperately grateful that there is no Sappy Sweetness or Heroism in the Face of Pain Green missed an opportunityObviously too much gritty realism and the book changes into something else entirely -- risking in fact becoming exactly what Green is trying to subvert But Hazel is dying of cancer -- and so the cancer should have been more present Showing these adolescents responding to weakness pain and the ugly reality of cancer -- in the way that these two bright brave interesting adolescents would have -- would have made this a better bookWhat the book has makes it worth reading It's good solid intelligent fiction It could have been literature
This book had me hooked from the 9th sentence on the first page  TFIOS is profound  I know many people are saying but  but  it's a cancer book  But it's not *that* cancer book  Cancer is personal to me - times two  It's not a topic people like it's not a subject that especially when it involves young teenagers in the prime of their lives that people flock too - we run we hide we shake our heads vigiliantly saying 'oh no oh no'  But this one is a keeper a literary work that left me in a state that many books have not  BRAVO John GreenThis is my first John Green book  I was BLOWN AWAY that it was written by 1 a man and 2 a man who assuming the picture on the back cover is correct is NOT 16 or anywhere near it Seriously  How a grown man can wrap himself into the character the persona the language and thoughts of a 16 year old girl is sheer brilliance  That takes skill and raw talent to pull offThe character is Hazel {Hazel Grace) who is a 16-year-old cancer survivor having her first near-death encounter at 13  She becomes a reclusive teenager having completed her GED instead of attend school due to her cancer and having to carry an oxygen tank and cannula everywhere she goes At her weekly cancer support group many characters are introduced which play an important role in this book from Isaac who will eventually go blind and his relationship with Monica to the ever fabulous Augustus Waters aka Gus who was left with just one leg after a cancer amputation  The two are so richly described and the ensuing relationship is one that blossoms from support love fear etc and Hazel's life is transformed immediately and profoundly She's given a second chance with a new cancer treatment drug that is buying her timeThis book teeters on having just enough sass and spunk and humor (Hazel) to get you through without being a total downer  Gus's character is flourishing  It makes you stretch your mind to places - especially a parent - you might not think about ever  gratefully so  This book is about life  About Death And about the journey  The description and sheer beauty of Amsterdam felt like I was there with them both  It was so rich and lush and dare I say romanticI think my only critic was that through-out the novel they are chasing down the answers to An Imperial Affliction and asked repeatedly What happens at the end  What about the Tulip Man  What happens to Anna  I disliked strongly the character Peter Van Houten but then I think he was the catalyst amongst a cast that we loved :)  So at the very end I felt like TFIOS just ended  Kinda like AIA  And now I want more  I want a future for Hazel for her parents  And as they chased Van Houten all the way to Amsterdam for answers I ask What happens to HAZELHands down: *5 stars*  You'll want to hug your kids  You'll want to hug EVERYONE after reading this  Just make sure you keep the Kleenex nearby when you crack the cover
John Green has done a good job with this novel summing up that search for the deep meanings and purposes in lives that are destined for the grave Many complain that the vocabulary is unrealistic in this book for two teenagers I think that on the contrary Augustus and Hazel realized that since their life would be so short they needed to spend more time thinking and learning to experience the world while they still could I think that this is so appropriate for them as well as us
The Fault in Our Stars is by far one of my favorite books The story is about a bold sarcastic teenager named Hazel Grace Lancaster whom has been struggling with Cancer for the past few years Her life has been impacted greatly by the Cancer and has left her with bum lungs puffy cheeks and an increasing state of depression At her painfully boring support group meetings she meets two people that change her life considerably the lovesick blinded Isaac and the one-legged (but still overwhelmingly attractive) Augustus Waters Their story is followed as they ask the biggest questions life has to offer and as they learn through ultimate love and untimely lossI kept thinking while reading this book how great it would be to use in a secondary English classroom The many themes found within the novel would be very beneficial to high school students whether or not they are suffering from a health impairment Hazel and her friends have the same questions as many young people about life and death their curiosity is just more urgent They are incredibly relatable characters and John Green helps the reader to understand sickness in an entirely new and personal way TFIOS is written so that the reader can grasp at what Hazel's life is like living with her sickness It depicts the hardships resulting from such an illness or impairment including: family stress changes in school environment the exhaustion of having a physical condition and yet how beautiful opportunities may always take place This inspiring novel expresses to the young reader that people are people disability or not and that anyone is capable of an adventureAlthough others in society (parents old friends etc) treat Hazel differently because she wheels around oxygen with her and wears a cannula her friends Isaac and Augustus and she share a special bond through their impairments and similar interests Their abruptness about the likelihood of death is shocking but would be useful to generate thought-provoking classroom discussions about how to lead a fulfilling life and what it must be like to have a much more immediate sense of death at such a young age What's great about The Fault in Our Stars is that it isn't a book ABOUT disabilities or cancer but instead the meaning of this short experience we call life that we as individuals are constantly seeking The characters just happen to be dealing with various forms of disease while they tackle life's greatest questions and explore what the world has to offer Their responses do reflect their situations but all the more useful for young adults to compare their ideas with those of peers whom live such a drastically different life
I can usually generate a comprehensive review that details the item in question  Usually I point out the ups and the downs and note whether or not it would be a reasonable purchase  Not this time  It's a great and terrible beauty that will be the best ten bucks you might ever spend
In a strange way I always sort of dread reading anything by John Green Weird right See I live in perpetual fear that one day he will let me down and his book will be less brilliant than I'm expecting My expectations when it comes to John Green are ridiculously high because basically he's like the god of the nerds and even in the books I like less his writing makes me laugh and makes me feel Despite this constant fear his books have so far improved every time with The Fault in Our Stars being his best yet dark and funny and honest and touching and hopeful and depressing and painful and perfect*wipes away tears*When people talk about this book the first thing they mention is the sadness of it of how many tissues are requisite to getting through this novel without emerging a snot monster at the end What struck me much more strongly though was the sense of humor and optimism running through the book even the darkest moments The humor doesn't subtract from the pain or the suffering; it humanizes it and enhances the strength of the charactersIn the past my main complaint about John Green's books (no I did not think they were all completely perfect) were the characters They were real but they were annoying and repetitive (especially with Paper Towns and Looking for Alaska None of them did I fall completely in love with although Tiny Cooper was close In Hazel and Augusta John Green's characterization has seriously hit its stride in my opinionHazel's voice is justincredible Her sarcasm her brutal honesty her anger her intelligence and her wit all made her one of the most wonderful narrators I've ever encountered I love the way she phrases things I love that she uses some words that I don't know the meaning of which really doesn't happen often in my reading Hazel feels wholly like a kindred spirit like we would be friends if we ever met which would totally never happen since we're both so anti-social Also she feels one hundred percent like a female to me always a remarkable thing for a male author to accomplishHazel and Augustus meet and there's an immediate attraction Though they immediately feel for one another on some level John Green deftly doesn't go anywhere near instalove territory For one thing there's Hazel's cancer which holds the two apart Even if there weren't and they immediately leaped into a relationship I would have been okay with it because the two legitimately develop a bond They wisecrack and have this insane rapport; they share a love of word play and navel gazing They trade their favorite novels and both go into the experience with an open mind even though the novels were not what they were expecting They are without a doubt one of the best most convincing most well-matched couples I have encountered in fictionThroughout The Fault in Our Stars John Green has woven a lot of thoughts about the value of fiction and about what a novel really is both to the reader and to the author Hazel's favorite novel An Imperial Affliction by Peter Van Houten is a work of literary fiction about a young girl with cancer; Augustus' is a series of novelizations based on a video game about the adventures of Staff Sergeant Max Mayhem While there's clearly a difference of literary merit between the two I loved how John Green stressed the importance of bothI feel like there isn't much more that I can say about this without cutting into your enjoyment of the book I realize I didn't talk about the cancer at all but I suppose that was intentional because the book isn't so much about the cancer as about the people who are partially made of cancer The cancer is them after all not a foreign element The book is wholly about cancer and wholly not though I know that probably doesn't make any sense What I mean is that this is in no way simply some weepy tearjerker stereotype of a cancer bookMy words are failing me so I leave you now with this: The Fault in Our Stars is everything I dreamed it would be and more John Green constantly increases his awesomeness With this novel he will break your heart repair said heart a few sizes larger make you laugh give you hope rip your heart to pieces again and basically tell you the utter truth about a lot of awful things also known as life
This is the first book I've read by John Green but it won't be the last Funny touching smart It made me laugh and cry and then cry again Bravo
I saw this book as a recommendation from Amazon and was impressed by the positive reviews  I came across it two days later while on vacation and decided to give it a read  I wasn't even finished with the second page and I knew I was going to love this book and I was right It is such an incredible story funny and sometimes sad You find yourself cheering for Hazel and Augustus as they discover first love and their adventure of meeting Hazel's favorite author I read this book in 3 daysand I am reading it again to really savor it this time I will definately be reading John Green's other books Any author that can have me in love with a book before I'm even done with the second page has a fan for life Maybe he will be my very own personal Peter Van Houten of authors Read this book You won't regret it
I'm not a person who likes Oprah books about murdered children or Nicholas Sparks books with a Requisite Tragedy I choose my angst with careAnd I'm glad I chose thisThis book is sharp and funny and unsentimental while being utterly trueEveryone is likable even if they are a messAnd it has I think the best set of parents since A Wrinkle in TimeOh I wouldn't mind Hazel Grace It would be a privilege to have my heart broken by you
As a mother who screens everything her 13-year-old daughter reads I've always felt conflicted when I come across a book that is brilliantly written brave and touching - but that which has in it certain actions that we as a conservative family would not otherwise condone under normal circumstances In the case of some wonderful books such as those by Sarah Dessen I put them on hold for when said daughter is older and more likely to encounter similar dilemmas In the case of The Fault in Our Stars by John Green I cannot recommend the book highly enough For those of us lucky enough to live a life in which the fact of death is a certainty but when death occurs is not we can afford to be conservative cautious and patient What happens when at 16 you *know* you're going to die Perhaps the bravest among us would still choose to live a conservative cautious patient life For those who choose to live life to the fullest they can barring hurting someone or something else surely we are no judge This is a humbling book and I am truly grateful it was written Said daughter's review follows:'The Fault in Our Stars' by John Green has to be one of the best books I have ever read yet because I believe that the best books are the ones that make you want to go out and DO something and this book made me want to cry my eyes out and at the same time march right up to God/Allah/Buddha/whoever and ask him: 'Why'Because really that is the only question in life we can't answer Why do people leave us Why do we have cancer Why can't we be happySixteen-year-old Hazel's life sucks Then again she has cancer in her lungs so her life is probably going to be pretty short But despite her parents worrying over her 24/7 and her friends abandoning her and the fact that she has to go to some so-called 'Support Group' which really just makes everyone MORE miserable than they already are Hazel is doing okay Not great not horribly - just okayAnd then she meets seventeen-year-old AugustusAugustus had bone cancer and his old girlfriend died from cancer as well But he is more alive than anyone Hazel's ever known - and they fall in loveBut Augustus has his own secrets and sometimes the worst lies are the lies you tell to yourselfOkay I know I already said this but I love this book Love it love it love it  Hazel is so funny and Augustus is so brave and the whole entire book is just so sad and wonderful and bittersweet and should totally be a classic :-)My favorite part though would have to be a toss up between the ending and the beginning - in the beginning Hazel hasn't met Augustus yet and he hasn't shown her how to *live* She was just existing In the end though Hazel knows how to live and she is living the best she can and it hurts a LOTI would have to give the book five stars (duh) : two stars for the plot two stars for the characters and one star for the writingRead This Book
The Fault in our Stars is a novel above life It also involves love Isn't it wonderful when someone comes along and restores your faith in true love Not the true love of fairy tales or the true love of an angst-y teenage novel involving vampires or werewolves or suicidal star-crossed lovers but true love meaning love which is true: Deep and honest and not really perfect yet endlessly perfect and infinite caring for another person which is has to be must be truly felt by some person towards some other person and reciprocatedI began reading The Fault in our Stars at around midnight last night I finished it at 600 this morningIt is beautiful I look upon the world with more joy and gladness than I did yesterday It messed with my emotions made me laugh and cry and crushed me and elated me just as every truly great book should The style is so easy and natural that it is impossible not to lose yourself in the beauty of the novelThe skill and depth of the author whose imaginings and philosophies have touched me and encouraged me and changed my outlook on the world amaze me I firmly believe that Hazel's story (and Augustus' and Isaac's and Hazel's Mom's and Dad's and Peter Van Houten's stories) will stay with me for the rest of my life having given me a fresh appreciation of the universe
The Fault in our Stars is a wonderful book There really are no words to describe it you'll just have to read it
The fault in our Stars was my first John Green book to pick up but will certaintly not be the last This book moved me tears in the best possible way  I would recommend this read to anyone so do yourself a favour and read this book
Funny sad scathing Writer obviously knows or has researched a lot about the process of dying I love this book
Very interesting book that might be considered about cancer but is more about two teens overcoming adversity throughunusual friendships Great metaphors and appealing to teens Humor and sarcasm well placed I taught it in a 10th grade class and we could have done so much with it if we had time
You're joking right Looking for Alaska was my all time favorite book Nothing could compare So when I saw this book I assumed it'd be good Same author it's about cancer Somewhat like the movie/book My Sister's Keeper I was in Although Green knows how to make a reader laugh I was quite disappointed It seemed more like a first novel before the masterpiece of Looking for Alaska It was much different and I wouldn't pick it up again
I am a life long 48-year-old ardent reader and this book just surpassed Olive Kitteridge as my favorite book of all time  Since that book won the Pulitzer things are looking good for you John GreenI read about a book a week and have only reviewed three books on Amazon  Surely this book-to-Amazon review ratio says somethingThis book now belongs to my brain cells  For the rest of my life  Whatever measure of Havel's infinity metaphor it ends up beingBrilliant BookJulie CristalShaker Heights Ohio

I am an adult a closer to forty than thirty year old woman and I really enjoyed this book I loved that it was honest about the struggles the characters were facing with their cancer I loved that the characters and not just the primary ones were fully developed and engaging Each character draws you into their part of the story and illustrates the complexity of relationships I loved that the family ties were never superseded or displaced by the teenage bonds that developThis book is smart The kids are smart The parents are facing heartbreaking realities The friends are faced with holding onto the pieces they are given
I don't really even know how I want to start this review This book is wonderful in all the ways a book can be wonderful It beautifully written and I was instantly attached to the characters When I started this book I read the first chapter and knew I was a goner I knew two things when I finished that first chapter I loved this book and I was going to cry You can't get that emotionally attached to characters in a book about terminal cancer patients you are going to go to piecesThis book is laugh out loud funny sorrowfully sad and smart I love John Green I have read Looking For Alaska (which is amazing) and Paper Towns His voice is real and authentic It sounds like how a teenager today would talk which is not something you get when you read Young Adult books they often leave out the swearing and the crudeness that often comes along in teenagery speech He does this in a smart way too he doesn't dumb them down to only swear words How the character speak is real but at the sometime smart and have specific voices Augustus Waters and Hazel Grace are both wonderfully real characters that I wish were my friends I just want to sit down and have a conversation with them But then again the world is not a wish granting factorySummery:Hazel Grace Lancaster has thyroid cancer A miracle drug has stalled the inevitable she is going to die She has slowly and deliberately withdrew from her world She doesn't go to high school spends her time watching horrible reality TV taking college classes and hanging out with her best friends Mom and Dad  She does this to minimize the damage that her impeding doom will have on loved ones Oh she still has a few friends from her old life but she keeps them afar This has been her life for about 3 years her mother wants her to have a life She makes Hazel go to a support group where she meets one Augustus Waters who turns her life inside out and upside down He is also a cancer survivor who lost part of his leg to a bone cancer Together they learn about love loss strength pain happiness and the universeThe part that makes this book so beautiful for me is the small details Like that Hazel names her oxygen pump Phillip and Augustus call her Hazel Grace Or the way they talk to their parents It is just beautiful and heartbreaking a must read John Green officially goes on my Authors Who I Always Buy Their Books list
This book literally blew me away I started to read it and would not put it down I read it consistently for 54 hours straight and was done I cried I laughed I smiled and for the past couple weeks John Green has become one of my all-time favorite authors The thought process of The Fault in Our Stars is phenomenal and extraordinary I cannot think of another book with as honest of writing that this book has (except other John Green books) and the worlds of Hazel and Augustus changed my view-point of life and gripped my heart They will never leave my memory nor will John Green or this book I am truly grateful for all its given me
There's so many other beautifully written reviews on this book that mine will probably seem repetitive and go unnoticed However I have to write my thoughts on it anywayWhen I finished reading TFIOS I went out into the living room to tell my mom about the story Excluding the spoilers this is pretty much what I told her:I really enjoyed John Green's honesty in this book He didn't over romanticize the relationship between Augustus and Hazel and didn't over dramatize the cancer situation From what I could see he tried to keep the situations as close to real as possible And what I mean by that is that if it were a real situation between two very real people the thoughts and feelings of said people would probably be similar to these characters Happy moments were happy sad moments were sad awkward moments were awkward and angry moments were filled with anger It was an emotional read but a very good read at that
If perfection can be achieved in a book then The Fault in Our Stars has achieved itI am overwhelmed by how much this story affected me  Even more so now that I'm studying many of the techniques used by John Green in writing this bookI'm not sure why I would ever feel compelled to pick up a story about a teenager who is struggling with terminal cancer but John Green's name has carrying power and so I did  What I did not expect was the bittersweet humor that was injected into every single pageSeriously for a book that (you would think) has a foregone conclusion (this is exactly what I thought when I picked it up - no spoiler here) would you expect to be laughing while wiping away tears  I expected the tears but not the laughterHazel's voice is so genuine that it gives me this pleasant pain in my heart to remember it  I get the pain because I miss her  She is someone I want to know and I somewhat resent the fact that she is merely a figment of Green's imagination  It isn't fairWhat else isn't fair about this book is the brilliant method in which Green puts a book into the book and the idea well read the book  I was astonished  My jaw literally dropped So so brilliantFilled with twists and turns - you cannot take any moment for granted in this beautiful book  I highly recommend you check it out as soon as possible
I just finished* it today I'm hesitant to recommend this book to many people but only because I think many people really don't want to spend their free time reading about dying children Which is understandable But it's really really good Certainly everyone who knows a kid with a terminal disease should have to read this and a lot of other people should read it anywayBoth main characters (the boy and the girl) are thoughtful and funny and sharp and witty and cynical and they make the story delightful to read Well 'delightful' insofar as a book about kids with terminal cancer can be delightful 'Delightful' in a way that leaves you crying for an hour But delightful nonethelessIt's young adult fiction but written in a way that that recognizes the 'adult' in 'young adult' and doesn't underestimate their capacity for nuance intellect and emotion It reminds me of the Maurice Sendak quote what is too often overlookedis the fact that from their earliest years children live on familiar terms with disrupting emotions fear and anxiety are an intrinsic part of their everyday lives they continually cope with frustrations as best they can And it is through fantasy that children achieve catharsisThe protagonist Hazel Grace is simultaneously wise and angsty though much more of the former than the latter This very precociousness is what makes the book so wonderful to read--she comes out with casual gems of wisdom that set this adult reader back on her heels But while she refers to herself as a 'kid' and a 'child' throughout the book you are hard pressed to remember that she is one This would really strain belief in most books (and it does to an extent here) but you can accept her precociousness if you accept that someone who is unique to begin with and is then forced to grow up far too fast could become so sage  The main male character Augustus shows a similar sagacity He's the kind every bookish teenager (or bookish 20-something) wants to fall in love with And I can that you will fall in love with him (and that it will make you feel pedophilic since he's 17)I caught myself about to rate it 4 stars but then realized that that was only because it's a little too young-adult for my taste But I can criticize a book for belonging to its genre So in conclusion this book gets the first star for making me think; the second star for making me feel so keenly; the third star for surprising me with its plot twist; the fourth star for making me skip dinner because I couldn't put it down; and the final fifth star for making me laugh out loud while there were still tears on my face**also started
I would really give this 45 stars but I am going to round up because I don't think I've ever encountered such beautiful and careful writing as that of John Green Each word sentence paragraph and chapter are so carefully constructed and so much thought has clearly gone in to every detailThe characters are so believable and carry such raw human emotion it's incredible that Green was able to take such a morose and unappealing (sorry) topic and turn it into a book that I would read not once but again and againThat being said a book about two teens battling cancer while falling in love is a book I would NEVER read I don't like sad stories and the premise of this book reminded me of the Lurline McDaniels books that repulsed me as a teenager Picking up this book the reader is very aware that there is going to be death pain suffering and sadnessOne of the most interesting relationships in the book to me was the relationship the narrator Hazel and her parents There is only one thing in this world sh--tier than biting it from cancer when you're sixteen and that's having a kid that bites it from cancer Hazel worries that she is a grenade that will ultimately destroy the lives of her parents The scenes between Hazel and her father or both of her parents especially toward the end of the book almost moved me to tears -- the relationships were so real and true to lifeI applaud John Green on tackling the topic of teenagers with cancer and turning this otherwise difficult topic into one of the most well-written books I've ever read I'll definitely be reading more books by this author Thanks for a great read
The Fault In Our Stars by John Green is not an inspirational novel for the dying nor is it a depressing novel for the living Hazel a teenage girl living (or dying as the case may be) with terminal cancer walks through the grey area between vivacity and death a sort of twilight that only those who are dying can experience Even though suffering is constantly in the background the characters rebel against what their bodies have dictated their lives to be like through use of their brilliant minds And that brilliance the characters possess is the soul of the novel the reason why it rises to such heights Hazel and Augustus do not accept their fates blindly and wallow in sorrow; rather they question everything and fight to make their existence mean something Their approach to life is immensely interesting John Green is a geniusThe Fault In Our Stars is to me what An Imperial Affliction is to Hazel A book with such value that it fills you with this weird evangelical zeal and you become convinced that the shattered world will never be put back together unless and until all living humans read the book
I'm going to keep this rather short and simple as my back is killing me and I need to lay down but having just finished the book I am obligated towards recommending it I'm not going to summarize the story as that's in the description you're able to read the first chapter on Amazon for free John promotes the book above and of course the many readers here have already reviewed and laid it out for you The progression of this book was so well-done that I couldn't put it down Heck I took it with me to class to read this morning (bad I know but this professor is completely book-oriented and I'm just there for the attendance) I immediately took a liking to most of the characters introduced appreciating their knowledge and backstory to their way of speaking or expressing themselves With quite a few books I've come across the author tends to show off his/her vocabulary and they have every right to they've earned their publication their hard work their knowledge on the language being quite impressive But with that it's difficult to imagine howin reality a boy of poverty struggling to get by to speak so adequately If there is a believable way to explain such grammar then I'm all ears or in this case all eyes Greene accomplishes this as we get a good sense of background and standing with the characters I know this seems like a minor quirk with books being narrated as such but nevertheless I feel that I must point it outAnyway the character development particularly of the main character Hazel has truly touched me Her struggle her rather realistic views her ways of coping with her complications it's all so inspiring And not the inspiring in a sense that hey this girl is strong and living and getting by battling cancer and everything but more-so in the sense that the book or rather Hazel's and a few other characters see themselves and see the world no the universe in such a substantial and unique way Their paths their lives takes many turns each with valuable lessons and growth In short I thoroughly enjoyed how real these characters feltThis book has reminded me just how precious life is You hear it all the time you don't know what you have until you've lost it here today gone tomorrow or I won't be around forever things loved ones have said but weren't taken to heart as we neglect and deny the thoughts of them -really and truly- leaving us But no we can't stay in that cozy dark cave forever We have to wake up and realize the truth behind these statements and cherish our moments together even more than before I believe our memories can keep us going upon losing that special someone as well as the support of family and friends On a more personal note relating to this realization I'm currently facing quite a few complications in my life Almost hitting the big 2-5 I've began getting rather sick late last year beginning with rather simple but annoying migraines day-by-day and now escalating into abdominal pains nausea dizziness sensitivity to light so on and so forth It's the nausea and abdominal pains that really keep me leveled it keeps me from activities and I hate that Before the end of last year I was able to get up get set and get out the house with ease But now now I feel like hell some mornings that I just don't have the motivation to go somewhere I'm invited to Butif characters such as Hazel and Augustus and Isaac can make this effort if they can keep going and they've certainly had it worse than me then I sure as hell will try to too It's worth going to that rather boring seminar with a relative worth heading to a friend's small business opening worth it all As unsociable as I am I now more than ever want to make the effort to at least show up and be there for others spend that precious little time that we have I don't prefer to be close with many I like my small circle just the way it is but it's as psychoanalyst Harry Stack Sullivan said loneliness is the most painful human experience And damn it it isIn any case I thank you for reading my attempted recommendation of this book Please you owe it to yourself to give it a read*Edit*Looks like it's getting a movie
I actually picked up the book at my school library(my school buys John Green's books because of me) the book was so good that I bought it I have never done that before then I read it for a third time
John Green is a favorite author of mine and yet I was reluctant to pick this one up simply because of its subject matter I am NOT a reader of cancer tales and in particular cancer tales involving children And yet this one kept calling to me; when my daughter read it and loved it I knew it was time assuring myself that with Green cancer would be a backstory to the main oneWarning:  It's a cancer bookOther than that minor (not) detail it's beautiful full of truth about human relationships and life Hazel is sixteen and has terminal cancer which has been held at bay for three years but stealing her lungs' capacity to their work (crap lungs)  Forced by her parents to attend a support group she meets the handsome witty Augustus who becomes infatuated with her almost immediately And though Hazel wishes to minimize the destruction of her impending someday death by not becoming a grenade she finds herself falling in love with the dashing Gus himself a survivor of bone cancer Together the two use his Wish to track down the author of their favorite novel demanding answers to its unanswered questions (A Metaphor For Life Certainly) Along the way medical crises ensue and lessons about the fragility of life abound And Green does all this with his usual funny endearing charming flair making us sob buckets and forcing his characters into our hearts whether we want them there or notWhile I adored the characters I did feel the necessity of involving cancer in their lives was manipulative and unnecessary though very realistic Green did his research; he knew  the ins and outs of how medical teams work and what can go wrong It's a story worth reading and definitely one that involves the reader fully I do wish Green would move on from the road trip drama but he's still one of  the best young adult writers out there today my personal feelings about cancer story lines aside He can make you laugh and cry and realize things you already knew Beautifully written and recommended
Though I read about 4 or 5 books a week this is my first time writing a reviewI was taken completely by surprise Intelligent thoughtful trueThat is all I can say at the moment as I am too tired to think because I stayed up all night reading the book then contemplating the book
Yes I was stunned at how fluent John Green is with what it's like to be dying in particular from cancer  He is on-the-money about it and Yes this is a brave bold book with amazing writing--truly amazing  But wait everyone--there are major problems with the book and I'm getting the idea John Green might be too big and the idea that his boundary-breaking (using sick kids as main characters) is too sensitive a topic for critics to find any fault in these stars I get it if that's true but let's really look at the book First why is Gus so immediately and so intensely attracted to Hazel  I kept waiting for there to be some kind of edge attached to it  Sure she looks like his ex-girlfriend but he simply falls too hard too fast  Okay I overlooked this because I loved Hazel and wanted  her to have some happiness and I loved Gus I was even happy with Green's understanding of girl-ness in Hazel And I liked the dialogue even though at some point all of the characters seemed to talk the same way and I stopped being able to tell them apart I still loved Hazel and Gus and Isaac  I love reading John Green because he's so smart and funny  But his editors were too easy on him and I think the critics of this book are too  The Imperial Affliction parts and all of the scenes with Peter Van Houten are plot devices that don't quite work In fact the last time Houten shows up in the book I thought maybe Hazel was imagining it--like it was some kind of dark humor  (But it wasn't It was just ridiculous) Here's another example:  two dying kids having their first kiss in Anne Frank's house  When the crowd applauds it's almost as if John Green is clapping because he thought up something so symbolic and ironic These two have just been through a major disappointment--so they go sightseeing With the housekeeper To Anne Frank's house And even though mobility and fatigue are major problems in their getting around the house they still can't fight off the need to kiss I was troubled by this book because I came to love Hazel's affection for Gus and the other story elements got in the way of that  The characters are well drawn compelling people but the plot around them is a let down Theirs is an important story--one I don't ever want to forget--about how afraid they are that no one will remember them But John Green with his talent and imagination could have done better by them  They deserved it
If you are a fan of John Green books TFiOS is definitely for you If you have never read one of his books this book is still for you He writes about such a serious topic with humor and truth Please don't say I'm not going to read this because it will make me cry Yes it will make you cry tears of sadness but it will also make you cry tears of happiness Isn't the testament of a good book that it pulls you in and makes you feel the emotions of the characters If you are looking for a great read then look no further than John Green's The Fault in Our Stars
I stopped by to see if everyone loves this book as much as I do  You love it you really love itI bought this book after reading its recommendation in both People and Entertainment Weekly  I whole-heartedly agree with Entertainment Weekly's assessment -- when a movie is made of this book PLEASE Hollywood don't toy with a great thingAnd now to Facebook to find John Green 
John Green as well as being an amazing author is also vlogger on youtube who inspires and educates hundreds of thousands of people called nerdfighters (we don't fight nerds we are nerds who fight) Some of these people are in a hit band called Bloom and they wrote a song that is in itself a better review than I think most people could give This is the link to that song[]
This is a great book It is well written and although it is sad it is ultimately very inspiring and thought provoking  There are also a lot of interesting literary aspects that make it fun to read and there are many humerous moments as well  Also it isn't just for teens adults can read it and enjoy it too
I read this book when it was recently assigned to our book club knowing only that it was a young adult novel and that the recommendation came from the sixteen year-old son of one of the book club members  Based upon that limited knowledge I started reading it with the expectation that it would be light superficial and predictable  I was wrong on all countsThe Fault in our Stars is a beautifully written book that offers a frank view of the lives of teenagers with cancer  Despite the heavy topic the book contained a realistic balance of humor and brutal honesty  As my sixteen year-old recommender stated it has about a 1:1 laugh to tear ratioThe book left me wanting more (which is the best thing that can be said about any book) so I did a little post-book research and was not surprised to learn that the author had a real relationship with a sixteen year-old girl with cancer no doubt the inspiration for this exceptional bookI don't want to give away too much so quit reading this review    and start reading this book yourself  You won't regret it  No matter your age you're not too mature for this young adult book  In fact you will likely feel humbled by itI know I did
I read this book just a few days ago and loved every minute of it When I tell people that I cried (a lot) they automatically decide that they don't want to read it But it's because they don't understand why I cried This book is perfect And complete And once you come to terms with the lives of the characters in The Fault in Our Stars it's hard not to become emotionally involved Hazel is a bright young woman whose inner dialogue makes Bella Swan look like a fifth grade drop outThis book has made me think about death in a way that I never have before and I can't wait to share it with friends Don't be afraid of the sadness found in the book To quote Doctor Who Every life is a pile of good things and bad things The good things don't always soften the bad things but vice versa the bad things don't necessarily spoil the good things and make them unimportant
John Green captures the viewpoint of a teenager very well and really connects to Hazel's internal world; however I felt the plot was verystrange  Almost like there were two stories happening at once that just happen to tie togetherthe story of Hazel and Augustus battling cancer and then the story of Hazel and Augustus' fascination with Peter van Houten and their trip to Amsterdam  I thought the plot was way too fast-paced with all the main events slamming you in the face immediately  There is no build-up to the relationship and very little conflict with regards to the trip (the only conflict is the internal battle with oneself)  Also I went to Amsterdam once for two days and the vacation is written as if John Green had done the same thing and just written about every little thing he saw instead of exploring the city with greater depth  In the acknowledgements he says he spent two months there though So in the end I found it awkward and I would have liked to see more character development  I couldn't feel for the characters because I felt everything unfolded too quickly and there wasn't a lot of opportunity of empathy
I don't know what more I can add to the fabulous 5 star reviews here but I will try  I was a bit put off thinking this was a Young Adult novel  I was not at all interested in the Twilight or Hunger Games series both of which earned enormous critical acclaim  I was reluctant to purchase this thinking it would be another novel which was widely adored-but not for me  I was so wrong  While the characters Hazel and Augustus are teens they are far more mature than their years in part due to their long term illnesses  The discourse in this book is sublime  The author really had me repeating lines in my head and writing them down in a journal because they were so meaningful  It is really difficult to write a novel about suffering and death without being maudlin over the top or flat out depressing  Somehow John Green accomplishes the impossible by making this novel more about love laughter family friends rather than the pain that each person in the novel experiences  This is a truly remarkable featand a book which should be cherished for a long long time
Before reading John Green's excellent novel The Fault in our Stars I had never read any of his other books I had seen a number of his brother's and his videos but this was the first book of John's that I have read Without knowing if I would even like it I decided to purchase this novel and boy am I glad that I didThis book has great characters who feel real and are portrayed brilliantly You quickly begin to fall in love with Hazel and AugustusI really recommend this book Do not let the fact that it's listed as children's fiction turn you off to it This is not a book for children but is for teenagers and adults I am sixteen and I loved itAfter reading this I definitely am going to read his other novels after reading this masterful story
I'll put this book in my top five all time books and it's at the top for the past year John Green tackles the most serious of life's subjects with a humor poignancy and depth that are of the highest quality literature Yet it's so down to earth and easy to read the zingers will sideswipe you with an unexpected potency I laughed and cried while reading it then dwelled on the many deeper messages and symbolism after I put it down A great work for all ages
The Fault in Our Stars is everything I wanted in John Green's new book and more Whether you're a die hard nerdfighter (the name given to Green's fans) or just looking for a great new book to read this is a fantastic choice I was alternately laughing and crying throughout the novel; it made me feel at times warm at times uncomfortable and always drawn into the truth of the situation Green's uncomplicated prose moves the reader swiftly through the work only then to be stopped dead by the simple beauty of a truth nestled seamlessly into the story (A few times I was staggered enough to put the book down and consider the logistics of inscribing some particularly beautiful statement onto a plaque poster or perhaps even tattooing it upon myself) In short The Fault in Our Stars is heartbreaking beautiful funny and John Green at his best
I'm not a crier but TFIOS really had me going in a few places; those extremely sad parts were balanced however with plenty of hilarious scenes that kept me laughing It's the kind of book that you want to read in one chunk if at all possibleFor me it was one of those rare books that when I was finished reading it made me feel like it would be grossly inappropriate to go on with my daily life without first taking a few minutes or more to think about the story both the parts that are told and those that are not(For those curious or keeping track my preordered copy was signed in green and there was no Hanklerfish or Yeti)
(Spoiler free)As a nerdfighter I was pretty much set to buy any book John Green writes I wasn't expecting anything extraordinary just a good book to read in bed And the very little I'd heard of the storyline promised tears which I did not want at all I could not have been more wrong This book is just as funny as it is heartbreaking just as silly as it is genius I've never been more surprised by a book in my life I'm 23 years old and I honestly thought I was getting too old for YA I started craving books with more substance with protagonists my age or older feeling I could no longer relate to teens and their teen drama I can't tell you how foolish that was This is not a teen story this is a HUMAN story With equal weight and value given to every single character- from the adults to the amazingly vivid 16 year old girl who narrates the storyI can't recommend this book enough You have so very much to gainThanks for reading
I was not aware that this book was for young adults when I purchased it As I began reading it it became clear that it was targeted to young adults although I still found the characters intriguing  I have two grown children of my own so I found this book difficult to read a times  I would have to put it down and give myself some time before going back to it  It's not that I didn't want to read it but it was emotionally overwhelming  Reading about young adults struggling with facing their imminent death is not easy to read about However their thoughts reflect what all of us have in facing our own mortality  Kids are just so open and frank with what their feelings are and express them candidly  The extreme fascination that Hazel Grace has  with the book she is obsessed with seemed like a metaphor for so many questions that she felt about herself  Would she just end with nothing else - just empty pages  Who doesn't want their lives to matter beyond their time hereThese kids had less time to make their stamp in the world but still so wanted to know their short existence mattered and made a difference  I almost felt like the author of Hazel's book was a metaphor for God who didn't ultimately seem to care how important the answers were for Grace Did that mean that God doesn't care about the pain that is inflicted on these kids but just inflicts without compassion This is a thoughtful sad book but we still somehow route for these kids and know that they do matter and we end up loving them ourselves
I went into this book having no idea what it was about All I knew was John Green had come out with a new book and that was enough for me So I'm going to give all of you the same option I had to just be completely surprised and blown away All I will say is that this was both the funniest and saddest book I have ever read I laughed out loud I cried real tears    sometimes at the same time This is a brilliant book John Green you are my hero
I am a huge John Green fan but must say I was a bit worried when the topic of The Fault in Our Stars was revealed  After all how was a book about two teens dying from cancer not going to be terrifically sad  How was it not going to contain countless platitudes about living life to the fullest that would ultimately ring hollow  And if it didn't contain such useless encouragements wouldn't it seem crass and harsh  I needn't have worried  While the book did include many traditionally trite phrases Hazel and Augustus give said statements their just irreverence yet seem to understand the need for some of their friends and family to have the words said  Hazel and Augustus appreciate the cliche of their short unfortunate love story  I  think the highest compliment I can pay this novel is that I didn't weep uncontrollably at its sadness Knowing the gist of the plot in advance gave me a chance to read beyond the the storyline and appreciate the crisp poetic language  There are so many beautiful phrases but I'll end my review with my favorite: You don't get to choose if you get hurt in this world old man but you do have some say in who hurts you  I like my choices  I hope she likes hers
Let me begin by saying I had very high expectations for this book John Green is one of my favorite authors and his book Looking for Alaska is one of the best I've ever read I've waited for TFioS for what seems like forever and I tried not to let myself get my hopes up But the book completely surpassed every hope and expectation that I had Bravo John Green This is a must read for everyone regardless of your age or genre preference
Absolutely amazing book If you haven't read this book yet you are seriously missing out Then after you read this book go read the rest of John Green's books
This changed my life it was amazing funny sad charming witty and pure genius I will recommend any and all of your books to everyone I know John They've helped me develop and grow a better person it opened up Nerdfighteria which has made me feel special DFTBA
The Fault in Our Stars maybe John Green's best book yet He fill the pages with poignant characters and creates a gripping plot with as many laughs as tears The protagonist Hazel is so well fleshed out that I sometimes wonder if he actually shadowed a teenage girl to get it so right His other characters like Augustus and Isaac are a revelation Green is at his best when he is painting the picture He punctuates it with humour and wit doing it with an ease that is breathtaking The plot takes you to emotional highs and lows and makes you feel emotion like only the great books canThe book does however has its shortcoming (but not enough to knock of any stars off this review) Dialogue While it is not apparent in this book as much as in his others There are moments in the book that make me say Huh For example all the teenage boys and girls I have been around no matter how smart cannot perhaps even conceive the brand of wit and philosophical thought Hazel and Augustus can It seems almost incredulous to me that a a 16 year old and a 17 year old discuss metaphors and existentialism with such abandon and so often in their life My friends could barely get past their Facebook page/social lifeThat being said I do think it is perhaps his best book and people should read a book that makes even a cynic believe there might bee something called true love
I am sure all of the pre-teen girls reading this will hate me but honestly this book is not great I think it is offensive to actual cancer patients and it is written like a 12 year old girl who has never kissed a boy I don't think this is a good read at all and I am upset that I wasted money on this What a terrible read about boring characters
This book contains all the elements that I find integral to a great read  It has good prose consistent meaningful and engaging dialogue romance friendship discovery of what was lost and family  Sometimes I think I have read all the good books left and then I pick up on like The Fault in Our Stars  and am happy to know otherwise LOKIB
John Green's The Fault in Our Stars is 313 pages of perfection I started it one night and did not stop I would look at my clock tell myself to go to sleep and then turn the page Even though I cried as I read the last 100 pages I already have read the book again It's heartbreaking and beautiful and one of those books that speaks to your soul
Loved this book so much that I encouraged my sophomore English class to purchase the book so we could read it together They all now have their own copy b/c they loved what I had been reading to them so much They like I are hanging on Hazel's every word Thank you for a book that's getting teens who don't already love to read loving this book
This book has left me with a tear stained face and lots of thoughts about life love and living This is amazing story that everyone needs to read This book makes you think about your own life and the choices you make and if you had borrow time would thoughs choices be different  Beautiful read with a storyline that will leave you breathless
This book is ok It can be a bit pretentious and repetitive It is like reading a soap opera where teenagers think like 55 year olds With all that said it is short and reads fast you can nap/read and even skip parts and you will still get it so it makes a good read when you are on vacations or just don‚Äôt feel like reading a challenging book
Initially the premise if this story seems like it would be depressing but it's really not I think this is due to how well John green develops his characters I felt as if I knew them personally and had a hard time forgetting them once I finished the book John greeb's writing is so spectacular that I've continued to read additional work of his
I absolutely love John Green and just about everything he writes This book is no exception I wanted to not rush through and really savor the story but I plowed through it far too quickly These characters their seemingly hopeless situation and their love story is not one that will leave you quickly I couldn't possibly recommend a book more
LOVE IT Better than the movie (even though the movie was good too)
It's so hard to read the last pages--until you read the last pages
Good book  a few mistakes that should have been caught in editing
Great book  Knew it was gonna be a tear jerker ending  Easy read
Outstanding Young Adult book  Extremely well written very moving
This book was a delight to read although the story did make me cry
Really enjoyed reading this book hoping the movie is just as good
GREAT Book So sad but still uplifting Definitely recommend it
good ended different than what expected when first opened the book
The book was great It came to me quickly and I enjoyed reading it
The story is OK  It's sad but without a real purpose or direction
ONE OF THE BEST LOVE STORIES EVER
Good story  Thought it would be sadder but the humor overtook it
Wonderful story Masterfully written Great read for young and old
At first difficult for me to follow  Got better toward end of book
the movie and the book is great they are fantastic 
Great read  Loved the book  So much to take away with reading it
This was quite the tearjerker  Well written and just sucks you in
This was a good book but not a great book Didn't like the ending
something different could have been better with nicer way to write
This book was absolutely amazing  A great read for every romantic
Splendid story Easy read Can't wait to see the film with my GF :)
The book is so much better then the movie and the movie is amazing
Wow what a great read Makes you think about how life is precious
Easy Fast read Great story line that keeps you turning the pages
Excellent book Read it in just one sitting could not put it down
Great book Really enjoyed reading it Now l hope to see the movie
I pre-ordered this book and was super excited when I not only had his signature in it but it also had a Hanklerfish too Arrived in perfect condition and this is an overall fantastic book and I highly recommend this book as well as the other three books John Green has written (Looking for Alaska Paper Towns and An Abundance of Katherines)
I've read a lot of books I'm an English major But nothing NOTHING has ever made me feel so much as this book has It's the perfect combination of laughter and sadness And I can say it is truly incredible the way John Green can capture the heart and soul of a character John Green knows people And this book well it demands to be read
First free reading book in more than a few months and well worth it Read it straight through with no breaks and enjoyed every moment of it I laughed I cried it moved me Bob The book was even one of the 150000 signed by the author John Green which was not expected at all Such unexpected bonuses made this purchase a wonderful choice
-SPOILER FREE-If you buy this book you will not regret it - it had me hooked right from the first paragraph and did not let up not even once it ended It made me laugh out loud it made me cry freely and the completely unexpected ending left me breathless I would recommend this to anyone over the age of 13 who loves to read
I love stories that make me laugh and then make me cry This book is so sharply witty LOL funny and achingly sadI loved every bit of it The 2 teenagers (Hazel Grace and Augustus) in this story belong in the same category as Juno (from the movie Juno) smart  precocious and so funny I will definitely read more of John Green's work
After a year of not going near a John Green book I find myself reading this wishing I had read it earlier I didn't think any of his books could beat Looking for Alaska and Paper Towns but it has Its just wonderful and it wasn't what I expected and that's what made it so great You're missing out if you don't read this book Its flawless
I first picked up this book the day it came out not knowing anything about the plot but knowing that John Green was supposed to be a pretty awesome guy and I would regret not getting it immediatelyI opened the book as soon as it was in my hands and realised it was about cancer I hadn't read any cancer books but I knew of their heart-wrenching slightly overdone reputation and was wary of continuing my reading but I had just spent 18 dollars on a signed copy so I didn't have a choiceI couldn't set it down until page 214 which just the mere thought of brings tears to my eyes I won't tell you why you'll have to read it to find out I am a fairly fast reader finishing the book within six hours of buying it and from forty minutes before the final page to an hour after finishing it I sobbed so hard that my parents were worried for my healthTo those of you saying that Augustus and Hazel were contrived metaphorical unrealistic: I agree with you They were unrealistic But that is the beauty of books - they take us into a different world where human beings can talk about Existentially fraught free throws the ghettoization of scrambled eggs and the faults in our starsIt has been what four months since this book was released and I have read it five times Each time I have cried and each time I have willed the world to have humans as excellent as Hazel and Gus The first book I recommend to people when asked no matter what age is The Fault in Our Stars followed by the rest of John Green's workThis book is made of metaphors many of his books are made of metaphors but what you must remember is that this book is a work of fiction as stated by the disclaimer at the beginning Fiction can be anything you want metaphor-obsessed teenagers eloquent cancer victims and true love that isn't creepyI highly suggest you read this book it has changed my view of literature in this year it was the last thing I read as a thirteen year old four days ago and it will stay with me for a long time Please read it and DFTBA
I was reluctant to read this book despite its glowing reviews everywhere I just didn't think I could deal with the subject matter of teens dying of cancer However if you think this you are missing out on one of the most beautiful touching stories about hope and the human spirit I have read It really is hard to find the right words to praise this bookFirst let's talk about characters The two main characters Gus and Hazel are two of the most memorable I have ever read Yes they may be a touch too clever but they have spirits Gus maybe does seem too good to be true but I can forgive it His search for metaphor in life is unique and his joie de vivre is inspiring Hazel accepts her fate in life but doesn't let it get her down Even the secondary characters are all intelligent funny and real You know these peopleI won't spoil the big surprise in the book but you will think you know what the end will bring but you don't That twist is heart-breaking and the reason you will shed many a tear I like that we don't have a final ending for all the characters but there is no need for a sequelThis book could have been horribly melodramatic but Green's writing elevates the book to the level of literary classic I believe I hope one non-explicit sex scene doesn't make it highly banned in high schools but I fear it will There would be so much to be discussed and mined in high school or college coursesI read this book in about 4 hours because I just had to know what happened but now I will go back and read it slowly to get all the nuances and enjoy the brilliant writing This book put me on a John Green orgy and I can only saw the man is brilliant I can't wait to read any book he publishes in the future
I've been avoiding writing this review because I just don't think my tear ducts can handle it But I need to do it because this is honestly one of the best books I have ever read This is the first book by John Green that I have read and I enjoyed his style immensely His writing is witty and elevated which only furthers the point that the main character is smart beyond her years Hazel has cancer but I could tell she is an old soul forced to deal with circumstances that no teenager should There are some main characters that I just can't stand in books because their wit turns into snark which turns into an annoying attempt at portraying teen angst John Green drove the line between funny and obnoxious with perfection There wasn't any point in the novel where I felt Hazel was a brat or annoying to listen to In fact all I wanted to do was hear her thoughts and keep reading to uncover her heartbreaking storyNow on to the boyAugustus Waters At first I wasn't sure about him Is he an arrogant jerk or is he that know it all guy you kind of love to hate I quickly realized neither were true I didn't ever want to hate him Yes he may be overly confident but his heart is too large for him to be a jerk He's the guy that was meant for Hazel and in their relationship you find a perfect storyFor me it's easier to write bad reviews than good ones Because I just don't have much to say besides this book is amazing and you should read it immediately My absolute favorite part of the book was when you realize why it's called The Fault in Our Stars I won't give it away because its something you should read in the bookAnd lastly tissues are required for this My face was a puddle of mascara when I was reading The last hundred pages were the worst and I had a steady stream going for the entirety of them But it was worth itI recommend this book for anyone who can readseriously
I was in love with this book when I preordered it I was in love with this book when my preorder was messed up and I had to wait an extra week I was so in love with this book that I bought a copy at Target read it got my preorder in and read it again I even went as far to go to every Target/Safeway/Walmart/Barnes &amp; Noble in my vicinity and set stacks of TFiOS under Employee Recommend shelves and end caps I did this because I believe TFiOS is a book that um yeah EVERYONE should readYes it's a teen book but no that does not mean that only those between the ages of 13-19 will enjoy it My mother read this book and she appreciated it I've persuaded teachers into reading this book and they've appreciated it If you are a human being able to appreciate any type of book you should read this oneOne of the biggest criticisms I've seen for TFiOS is that the dialogue and characters in the book are unrealistic To those I say: pah As a sixteen-year-old girl I can relate to these conversations A lot of young adult fiction includes simplistic demeaning dialogue that in no way represents the way teenagers communicate We have personalities and think strange things and make funny jokes and have wit If you don't believe this then you aren't hanging around the right type of teenagersAlso the deep thinking of the book is said to be questionable of a teenager even one that is dying Um Okay Dude Again let me say reiterate: we have brains We use them While contemplating the meaning of life and the finite quality of our existence etc etc may not be as teenager-y as compulsively posting meaningless statues on Facebook or walking loops around the mall we still do itTFiOS is realistic It's heartbreaking It's hilarious It will stick with you And if you don't believe me - read it for YOURSELF
John you can still do better I believe in you But this is still amazing The characters feel real and brings focus to the person and not the illness This story hits me in the feels It made me contemplate my own life and what I'm choosing to do with my time on this earth It's inspirational and makes me want to help reduce world suck
I'm not one for reading many books but when I do I try to make sure they are well written and wonderful This book definitely doesn't disappoint It'll have you laughing and you'll feel like you're travelling along with Hazel on her journey throughout the book By the end of it you'll be craving more books from John Green A MUST READ :)
Had a hard time getting into the story and didn't like the ending
Wonderfully written Character development was rich and plausible

It was a great read very sad but real account of cancer patients
It was a good book to read Kept my attention all the way through
I am still reading this book I think it is z little slow starting
I like the book but it was not as great as it was made out to be
The book was good It just didn't hook me like I thought it would
Beautifully written book by an amazing author Be prepared to cry
Superb story not usually my type of book but took a chance on it
bought this book for my daughter she seemed to like it just fine
Bought it on my kindle and loved it had to purchase the hardcover
Great read for some brain candy  Have a kleenex ready at the end
Excellent warranted storyline I loved this book Thanks John Green
I Laughed I cried everything about this book is just Amazing
The book had me from the beginning to the end  Fantastic reading
Beautifully written and a wonderful story that will capture anyone
Loved it Well written I hated having to stop reading each night
This book is beautifully written  I loved the dialogue between the characters--it was honest raw and so clever  John Green was able to create characters that came alive were believable easy to love  You won't regret spending a few hours reading this book  Don't start it too late at night because you won't be able to put it down
Though I must admit this isn't my favorite of John Green's books it is certainly as good as everyone's been talking about it  John Green is one of those authors where all his books are funny yet sad deep yet somewhat silly  He definitely is the author I've read most of that hasn't written any series  I recommend all of his books
Some how this book touched me in a way I didn't know a book could It was fantastic I don't think it has a genre because it has aspects of every single genre I love it so much I re-read it after I finished it the first time I've never re read a book Thank you John Green for this wonderful book I will never forget itGush Gush LOL
This book was literally the only thing I read for a month I read it 5 times and I just couldn't put it down If you're looking for a good read then you should definitely consider this book at the top of your list The way it captures your attention and makes you want to keep on reading it makes you feel like this was money well spent
FRENCH THE LLAMA The Fault in Our Stars was such a phenomenal book It made me laugh and cry and have all of these feelings that I don't think I've felt over a book John Green you are one of the best most talented authors I've ever had the fortune of stumbling upon If you're thinking about reading this book DO IT It's beautiful
I know most readers found this book amazing but for me all it did was give me anxiety about ever getting cancer Depressing book
I cried like a baby The book is sad but so beautifully written
Great book (and movie)  Emotional funny and very well written
definitely a tearjerkerprobably more appropriate for teenagers
Awesome book  My 12 year old granddaughter recommended it to me
I  loved the book I also loved the movie such a touching story

Book is different very sad book  Enjoyable and makes you think
Great book  Cried on my flight while reading the last few pages
GHjjnbcghnmkiuhvvccff j j j j j v n j c n c n c m  N n n n
Really llovely book A bit sad but in a different point of view
Was real to life but could get you down at times when reading it
It's exactly what you would expectand I expected to love it
Great book  Couldn't put it down  Can't wait to see the movie
Absolutely awesome book  Yes it is sad but worth the good cry
Very good book Awesome read suitable for young adults and teens
One of the best books I have ever read  Incredibly well written
Haven't seen the movie yet not sure I want to Excellent story
Great read makes you appreciate the people you have in your life
Good simple read  Pretty much nails pediatric oncology patients
Nice read I was so immersed in it I finished it on one Saturday
Great book love the fact that there are movie shoots in the book
I read the entire book in about 5 hours Could not put it down
Awesome story highly recommended but don't forget the tissues
Loved this book It gave me an insight I had never thought about
Great book It was a tear-jerker for my fellow softies out there
Great writing memorable characters and a captivating story line
So I picked this book up because it was just SO recommended Everywhere people would tell me read tfios Well I did this book was brilliantloved the writing too much foul language for my morals but still a wonderful book It was irritating because of some of the foul language and references but I couldn't put it down for long
I'm literally crying right now Not from sadness but happiness This book was pure bliss laced with hardship and misfortune And not in a tacky or humorous book I've fallen in love with Augustus and Hazel John Green I'll be looking forward to read more books of yours Definitely deserves more than 5 stars - countless infinites
I bought this book because I had seen a few of my friends reading it I had no idea that it would be as good as it was It was very real about life and very sad but not overly sad I cried when it ended The book is really powerful and one of the best I have never felt compelled to write a review before but I do with this book
Amazing Amazing No seriously A-MAZ-ING I laughed and I cried well more like sobbed uncontrollably This book was phenomenal I loved Augustus Isaac and Hazel Their humor kept me laughing and Hazel and Augustus love story was beautiful Wow (So amazing I can barely string together coherent thoughts after finishing it)
Hazel Lancaster is proclaimed a miracle patient having undergone a medical procedure that shrunk her tumor and prolonged her life Three years after the surgery Hazel begrudgingly attends a Cancer Support Group with other teenagers who know every waking moment may be their last It's enough to bring anybody down and Hazel despises going One day however she spots a new face in the crowd Augustus Walters He's witty interesting and just plain weird They strike a simple friendship that soon grows stronger as they bond over books video games and the trip of a lifetime Despite the constant scrutiny of those around them Hazel and Gus determine to live a life that is not defined by their illnessesI was hesitant to start this book at first- not sure if I had it in me to spend a rainy day reading about terminally ill cancer kids However I was hooked from the first page This was my first John Green book and I absolutely loved every word He has a way of bringing characters to life and making their world real That's not to say that I know any teenagers who actually talk and act like Hazel and Gus but I don't think that's the point While other reviewers saw this is a negative aspect of the book I think one of the purposes of good literature is to challenge your assumptions and show you a part of humanity you might not have understood before As a teenager I probably wouldn't have been friends with Hazel or Gus but I can still become emotionally tied to them as a reader looking in on their worldI found this book extremely moving and well-written It's a quick read that is great for both teenagers and adults Highly recommended
John Green is definitely one of my favorite authors When I saw that this book came out I was so excited to read it I honestly couldn't put this book down I would stay up until 2:30 in the morning reading this It is a little sad but very uplifting in the same way If you are a fan of John Green I recommend you read this one
It was a good story line that flowed well  Very bright and real
Unforgettable characters in a well-crafted story full of wisdom
Having a granddaughter with cancer this book hit close to home
This is a real tear jerker but great book  It was well written
Loved the writing it was a very poignant story but so well told
Enjoyed reading this and was glad to know the basis of the movie
What a great book One you just can't take a break from reading
Great love story  Book is even better than the movie as usual
A sweet easy read that is both simple and complex  Tear-jerker
I really don[t like stories like that  Just a personal opinion
Overall it was a good book There were some boring parts though
Book in great condition and my daughter loved reading the novel
love it It is very good I'm happy with this prurchase Thank you
Incredible story  Very touching hilarious  and a tear jerker
Was a very touching and funny book Can't wait to see the movie

My most favorite book in the world and suggest that you read it
Fresh view on a fatal love story  Good read for moms and teens

Funny in parts but have your Kleenex ready  Very well written
Not sure this book is directed towards adults but I did like it
Thus book is simply amazing Funny tragic beautifully written
This book is so well written that I don't want to see the movie

Great book everyone should read this no matter what your age is
I could not put it down Well written and such a precious story
Quick read Great book one of those you don't want to put down
Seriously wow I just finished listening to this audiobook which is an excellent production of an amazing book I happened upon I laughed I cried I would recommend this book to everyone I know and I am seriously considering giving it to everyone on my list as a Holiday present Definitely the best book I've read all year
This is by far the most beautiful and inspiring and touching books I have ever read I just loved everything about it the characters and their personalities the jokes the plot line everything I would recommend this book to anyone and everyone and I truly think the world will end if everyone in it doesn't read this book
This book touches on so many things that cancer patients teenagers and even some adults experience and struggle with in life I particularly enjoyed the slower-paced scenes when the two of them were just together in those calm moments when everything and nothing was happeningBeautiful book highly recommended
I only have praises for this book I love how it's honest and heartwarming and how the characters are witty and comical and engaging despite their difficult situations I love that it's awkward like how teens should be with cancer thrown in the mix It's profound without trying so hard to be I just love it Five damn stars
A student recommended that I read this book &amp; I am so glad I did  I love the emotional levels of the novel  Green has done a wonderful job of taking a tragic situation and bringing hope humor and humanity to it  I read a lot and about once a year a book takes my breath away  The Fault In Our Stars is that book for 2012
I read this book all in one day It was impossible to put down The words just jumped off the page and seemed to dance around me literally they did It was such an amazing story I'm not ashamed to admit that I cried a lot I must say that this is my new favorite book It deserves all its praise and it's wonderful reviews
So I bought this book for my kindle and when I read it I knew I had to buy it as an actual book it was that great So I ordered it using standard 3-5 day shipping but it came the next day to my pleasant surprise The best part it was a SIGNED copy that I didn't think I was going to be lucky enough to get Thank you amazon
I have read this book 3 times And I will keep reading it for the rest of my life It is no doubt my favorite book I cry every time I read it no matter what All at the same parts too John Green is amazing and hands down one of the best authors I have all of his books actually But The Fault in Our Stars is his best yet
John Green is one of those talented authors who can make you fall in love with a fictional character While reading The Fault in our Stars you will no doubt fall in love with Augustus Waters' character If you are even thinking about reading this hilarious yet heart-breaking book buy it immediately and get to reading
Not as good of a read as I was led to believe by other reviews
You'll laugh and you'll cry You'll mostly cry Very good book
Brings awareness to the public about Thyroid cancer Sad story
Very depressing book Stopped reading half way through the book
very touching story  Had a surprise ending I wasn't expecting
Excellently written from the point of view of a cancer patient
I don't think kids of that age talk like that or act like that
Love this book with a passion Be prepared with a box of tissue
Movie and book go hand in hand Written so lifelike Very good
I bought this for the woman I love and she loved it Great book

Tragic love story with surprises and intense human interaction
It's a great bookeasy read Read it in less then 24 hours
It was recommended to me by several friends and family members
I am a happy fan of John Green via he and his brothers YouTube videos I bought this on his suggestion hoping that it would deliver It most certainly did Before today I would have been hard pressed to believe that a healthy adult man could so unbelievably pose as a dying sixteen year old girl but there you have it
Anyone who rated this book under 5 stars has no soul I'm a tough girl and I pride my self on my little emotions Reading this book a weeped like a baby In public John Green has ruined my life in this best way possible I fell in love with all of these characters and just wish I could have more adventures through them
Books like this are the reason John Green is my favorite author  The dialogue between the characters is amazing and I couldn't put this book down  The writing is incredible but he makes you care so deeply about the characters that the writing is almost an afterthought  Loved this book  Can't wait for his next one
All I can say is WOW I could not put it down despite needing to be asleep If you need an amazing book read this **Spoiler Alert- You WILL cry** You will also laugh sigh and hold your breathe waiting to find out what comes next This work will play on your heart strings and leave you wanting to read it again
Perfect Best book ever written R r r r e r e e e e e e e e e

When I looked best sellers on Kindle this novel was front runner I had no idea what it was about and I probably wouldn't have read it if I knew I am thankful that I did In fact I couldn't put it down What I liked about it was the ability tTo get beyond the cancer to reach the real people who were actually exp
amazing character development this is a moving book it left me in tears but in the most beautiful way John Green is an artist with his words and his creation of these beautiful fictional characters that I always am left wanting to learn more about great read great author i highly recommend all of his books

I cried 7 or 8 times reading this book I enjoyed this story
Loved it The movie was very similar to the book-thank you :)
Funny dark kind of a predictable Love Story plot
Although this was sad story the author made it an easy read
Thereupon words to describe how amazing John green is as a writer I didn't think I would get attached to this book like I did But you feel the emotion without really feeling it You feel as if he's jumped into your body and knows your feelings He really knows how to but feelings into words It's brilliant
Brilliant witty dialog and beautiful writing I absolutely loved this book John Green wrote a beautiful romance between two teens with cancer The secondary characters are great too you really get to know everyone in the story An emotional read that is just fantastic I will read this one again and again
My first John Green novel and I LOVED it  Much laughter and a fair share of tears; when a book especially a fictional book can evoke feelings this strong it is worthy of the highest rating which is why I gave it all five stars  I can't say enough about this story except do yourself a favor and read it
John Green completely consumed me in this world Everything about this story and the way it was written really moved me I would recommend this to anyone Short sweet and powerful Make sure you have some tissues handy if you get emotionally invested in your reading Wonderful One of my favorites by far
I don't know that I can contribute any more here that has not already been written  This is a wonderful book  I absolutely fell in love with the main character Throughout I found the writing simply excellent  This is probably the best book I have read all year  I really look for more from John Green
Good book  Easy read  Important topic  Not preachy  Sad
I enjoyed reading this book very much Well done John Green
Heartbreaking and real portrayal of cancer from a teen' POV
Very different perspective on dealing with terminal illness
Loved it Can't wait to read more of John Green's books
I love this book sooooo muchI was touched by the story
My daughter loved this book and wants me to read it as well
Great story Made me get pretty emotional but was wonderful
Thank you this is real good story for sad Have a nice day
I think this book had a slow start but a really good ending
A great story even for adults as we've all been teenagers
It's brave sweet honest funny and you WILL need tissues
read this to catch up with my granddaughter worth the read
I really enjoyed the book and now I have the movie to watch
It's a good story I just didn't like the foul language in it
I thoroughly enjoyed this booked Way better than the movie
It was a great read  Would recommend it for anyone to read
Awesome Very close to the movie But the book is way better
Amazing book All I can say is WOW And tissues required
I am probably the only person who couldn't get through this-
Well written breath taking love story Loved an every page
good book careful if you are young Its an older teen book
I love this book It is sad but uplifting at the same time
great read Beautifully written excellent twist at the end
Definitely a YOUNG ADULT book Haha It's very sweet though
She really enjoyed reading this one before seeing the movie
It was a sweet heart touching book  And yes it made me cry
Never cried so much Such a good book from beginning to end
Good price and fast shipping My kid love this book Thanks
I liked it okay  It was very predictable Writing was good
Obviously sadness but what an adventure Really enjoyed it
great insight to the characters  the story kept me engaged
My daughter loved this book and then went and saw the movie
Awsome bookenjoy reading with My sixteen yrs Old daughter 
An excellent book with unforgettable characters I loved it
I love eeee this book i cant wait to see the movie^œâ^(‚ô°ÀôÔ∏∂Àô‚ô°)
The writing was as joyous as the topic was sad  I loved it
It was the best book I have read in a long time loved it
It's as wonderfully painful as it is brilliantly articulate
This is the type of story that's hard to put down Needless to say i finished this book in a day and cried over and over Its a hard read if you've been a victim of cancer in some way or form Get your tissues readyPS I really don't understand how some people gave it one star Crazy people
John Green does it again He wrote this book and changed my life Made me quit a habit I never thought I'd give up He showed me the life in the dying he held my hand when I cried And gave me friends who I miss so much This book is worth every cent Every moment you get to spend reading it is a gift
Its strange reading a book you imagine will end sadly yet laughing all the way though Especially when asked what you are laughing at The book does a good job of not only telling a fascinating story but also showing how young love is I would recommend this book to anyone it is surprisingly hilarious
This is an incredible book about the struggles of the living and the dying The sparkly humor and wit that graces the main character immediately draw you in causing an unexpected connection to a teenage girl despite the age of the reader It is absolutely a must read for anyone anywhere at any time
I loved this book After reading Looking for Alaska also by John Green I couldn't resist going back for more It was sad yes but also inspirational Learning to live is hard but important and this book puts an excellent perspective on things I would recommend it to anyone (and I frequently do)
John Green never fails to write something amazing and The Fault In Our Stars is no different It is beautifully written and is truly a book that will have you laughing out loud and crying all within the same novel I highly recommended this to anyone boys girls young and old All will enjoy it(:

One of the best books I have read but it was so sad tooüò≠üò≠
If you need a good cry this is definitely the book to read

Beautiful story of life and young love by John Green
Enjoyed reading this book I was finished before I knew it
Extremely well written Couldn't put it down Great ending
I loved this book Unexpected ending  I really enjoyed it
Good book just didn't like how the ending left you hanging
This story really touched my heart and ended way too soon
I wish I had not started it but I had to get to the ending
IT was just okay I don't know what all the hype was about
Easy to read You feel such a connection to the characters
Awesome book Great story you will cry but a great story
Loved the book  I am looking forward to seeing the moviie
John Green is an amazing author this book is a work of art
Perfect book for youung adult of all sexes and backgrounds
I really enjoyed this book Was hard to put it down Martha
This was a great easy read  Now I have to watch the movie
I liked the book a lot  it seemed more for younger readers
Quick read and a compelling story Really enjoyed the book
Wonderful story I saw the movie but glad I read the book
The dialogue was excellent A great but heartbreaking book
I fell in love with both hazel and Augustus I miss them
The subject matter was very sad but I couLdn't put it down
I loved this book and could not put it down  The relationships and emotions felt real The characters felt real I particularly liked how they lampooned the rituals of the cancer support group but then resorted to utilizing them as mantras when the going got tough One of my favorite reads ever
I loved this book so much i'm an avid reader and i can usually jump right into another book but this book took time to get over i was completely moved by the characters After this read John Green is one of the first authors i recommend This is definitely the best book Green has ever written
My son had to read this book for school He never finishes books he starts but this one he did and loved it So I decided to read it too and I agree with him that it is well worth reading We downloaded the book on my kindle and his tablet Its great to be able to not go into a store Great book
It's not a bad book but it is far far away from a 5 stars The character are flat and constantly sound phony  the plot as a whole sound cheap specially in the second half of the book It's entertaining and in a some moments touching but I finished it feeling like it was a good idea done badly
A funny poignant and moving novel that draws you into a world that is unfamiliar to most of us and reveals how various characters react under gruesom pressures If you like to have your thoughts and sensibilities challenged wjhile being made to feel different emotions you will love this book
I heard about this book on VPR so i went and picked it up  i have to tell you that it was one of the fastest reads ever  i think i read it in about 2 or 3 days and it was just so awesome  the story is beautiful and it will have you laughing one minute and crying the next  BUY THIS BOOK
It was sad very sad Tear-worthy sad honest and realistic in its own sense It might make you feel depressed about life and you would very much appreciate the existence of the Make A Wish foundationThe way these two unique individuals talk is so not very common and it might confuse some as it surely did to me although you get their general gist I think I don't know I just know that it was very sad for them to go through what they did and think just how unfair life really is We get the perfect lives that we are in now and complain about everything and these two are just brilliant and amazing and they know how to see all the pain in the world and they still go on We as humans are just so strong - if you can see how these people in the story cope with everything that hits them The strength is endearingWhile I am only giving it 3 stars (to indicate that I liked it) the overall depressive mood it put me in really sucks It's reality but still it just depresses me I did cry at the part that everybody would be crying at and I appreciate the honesty and everything that encompasses it I especially appreciate how the two protagonists think and just their entire unique way of communicating That sort of dialogue is not something you would experience in real life At this point I don't think I'm making sense to myself anymore And I did feel like that throughout the book but it wasn't important enough to linger overThat is all
Typical
I wasn't sure what to think about this book when I read the reviews but my son recommended it to me and I am so glad he did I LOVED every minute of it even the sad ones I truly hated to get to the end of the book It was heart-wrenching at times and then LOL funny at other times Do read
The fault in our stars is another great book from the always wonderful and extremely intelligent John Green A book that will take you on a roller coaster of emotions break your heart and piece it back together all in one book Five stars though I have never rated a John Green book any lower
the subject manor hit close to home it was very touching
A tear jerking great read  My daughter loved the book 
good story made me cry and easy read and easy to follow
Very sad but very real true portrayal of death and dying
Loved this book It is sad and beautiful at the same time
The book came in great condition and i just love this book
Read  the book and saw the movie  Followed it to the tee
Really enjoyed this book; had a hard time putting it down
Loved the book - written with compassion and understanding
The reader was excellent And the writer was just as good
Sad but surprisingly humorous book Definitely a must read
Great book loved movie Did actress Woodley influence me
My second favorite John Green book  First is Paper Towns
Bought this book for my teenage daughter and she loved it
This was purchased for my teen daughter and she loved it
Movie was a lot better Usually it's the other way around
Such a great read I couldn't put the book down LOVED IT
My granddaughter loved this  It was just what she wanted
Well written but obviously for a younger audience than me
A very real authentic way to face sickness death and love
love the John green and this book Was in great condition
Horrible book DONT READ IT 5/5 stars though *cries*
Wow I laughed cried and wanted to yell  I also prayed
Great book I couldn't put it down and read it in one day
A sweet and smart look at loving while living with cancer
Honestly this has easily become one of my favorite books
I thought it was a good book just did not like the ending
i loved it  i consider this a flashlight book  that mean
I really enjoyed this book  I cant wait to see the movie
Great read  True depiction of illness's effect on family
My brother was very happy with my gift- his words LOVE IT
Great book  Live each day to its fullest and enjoy life
A different look at cancer and love  A good but sad read
This book was really good but I'm disappointed in the end
As much as I read I think it was an average piece of work
Amazing book Could not put it down Recommend for anyone
my grandaughter loved it The movie did it justice as well
an absorbing insight into the world of the terminally ill
It was a good easy read with the right amount of emotion
Brutally beautiful story Strong sophisticated abd sweet
Very sad but very touching at the same time Well written
Love the characters Great writingcouldn't put it down
A great book and one that you can cry all the way through
I enjoyed reading this story I thought is was a good read
The first time I have cried reading a book in a long time
Very redundant and predictable but overall an ok story
John Green is an awesome writer This book tells a story of two people who fall in love A girl with cancer and a boy with one leg This story is touching You feel like you are this girl Hazel This book brought me and my friends to tears I would recommend this book to anyone from ages13+
I don't think I have ever cried so hard reading a book I loved these characters and connected with them in such a way that made me grieve when this book was over So touching I can't imagine being one of the many families that go though this this situation every single day God bless them
It was amazing but I hated it at the same time Why did Augustus have to have a relapse Why did Augustus have to die Why couldn't him and Hazel live happily ever after But I guess the real world isn't like that I hope everyone gets a chance to read this book to see what love feels like
I could hardly put this book down and it instantly became my favorite love story I have ever read I became so addicted and entangled in the story that it made me emotional and I'm sad that it ended I definitely recommend this book and hope the movie does this amazing book some justice
John Greene did it againwrote another excellent book I don't want to spoil it for readers but remember to pick up some KleenexThe characters are so well developed and the story sucks you inread it one nightThanks againfor writing a beautiful book This is a keeper
Read this for our book club or wouldn't have read it  So glad it was selected as one of our 'reads'  It was a very well written book with a lot of thought provoking happenings  The characters were well developed along the way with what felt like many 'real life' feelings and happenings
I had seen many reviews on this and decided I would check it out I would say it was a great choice in doing so This book was amazing Sad funny sweet It was everything you could look for in a book and I loved it I would highly recommend every one reads it I plan to again Amazinggg
I have not cried like this from a book in a very long time  Poignant beautifully written and so real  Hazel Grace and Augustus are a phenomenal couple who have been dealt a crappy hand of cancer  Their love story is original and inspiring - I loved it and would highly recommend it
It was my daughter's recommendation and I just loved it
Love story with an angsty twist It'll make you ugly cry
Thought it was a really good book that kept me entranced
Just as good as the movie finished it in like 3 days :-)
Very touching A little too short though for my liking
Really good fast reader liked the story Sad but yet not
Enjoyed the book-anxious to see the movie now to compare
Very good book  We will be watching the movie next week
One of the best book I have read Amazing Amazing story
Great moving story about life's hardships and young love
Sweet book Appropriate for adolescents and young adults
Excellent read Sad but at the same time so entertaining
Fantastically written A great read for teens and adults
Heartbreaking story but i knew that going in Good book
Loved the book--started reading and couldn't put it down
This is a perfect love story and is just simply amazing
It was a beautiful story that needed some better editing
It is written with such love and understanding and dying
Loved it loved itBeautiful gripping as well as humerous
I cried for TWO hours straight after I finished this one
Wife loved it  I didn't read it but my wife loved it
I loved this bookit could happen to someone you know
Sweet and tragic One of those love stories for the ages
Great book My 14 year old daughter couldn't put it down
I enjoyed this book very much but it's a heart wrencher
easy to read Fairly predictable but a sweet love story
A beautiful novel that brought me to tears several times
Very well written a little disappointed with the ending
It was difficult for me to attach to Gus because he seemed so protected by barriers and emotional walls He never seemed genuine to me It sucks cuz I feel like the book didn't really do s*** for me I wasn't sad or inspired I was just waiting for Gus to not be perfect Strange I guess
This book was absolutely amazing I am looking forward to reading other books by John Green Its one of those books you would read time and time again without it ever getting old I am actually stuck between this book and The Perks Of Being A Wallflower because they are both phenomenal
This book was honestly one of the best books I've read in a long time It has a unique storyline and quirky wonderfully developed characters It's one of those books that makes you think I highly recommend it to anyone who wants a funny heart-wrenching and beautifully written novel
This isn't your typical book about people with cancer who die This book will make you laughtake you on an adventure and let you in on a beautiful story of love between Hazel and Augustusthe worst part of this book isyour broken heart afterward :(Loved it so much
This book is the most well written book I have ever come upon and the best story line This book makes me want to just jump into that world and hang with the characters I really can't express how much I love this book I am pretty sure anyone who reads this will become obsessed too
I brought this with high hopes with all the good reviews and I finished it very satisfied Athough I cried my heart out I couldn't put the book down I love the author's writing style and will definitely purchase more of his books Can't recommend it enough A must read for everyone
This has to be one of the best books I have ever read  I laughed cried and just can't stop thinking about it  it leaves you feeling lousy that you don't appreciate the little things in life but also makes you feel so good at the same time  Just can't say enough about this book
This is the first time i write a comment but it has to be said: this book is really wonderful and I can truly recommend it to everybody who is looking for an emotional romantic and humorous bookI am jealous with all the people who have not yet read itEnjoy
Book was okay  I will not recommend the book to anyone
Amazing bookMade me cryI recommend this book
I enjoyed this story very much and loved the characters
This is a very thought-provoking book A real must read
Fast shipping great conditon and great book thank you
It was a very good book But I didn't expect the ending
Witty funny heart breaking novel  Loved it a must read
Beautiful read Cried on the airplane Totally worth it
gift for a friend they spent the whole night reading it
Once I started reading the book I couldn't put it down
I thoroughly enjoyed this book it was very well written
Enjoyed the book - made me cry  Didn't like the ending
Great book allowing the feelings of dying to be explored
The actual writing style annoyed me  But great story
great read - romantic deep makes you reevaluate life
Makes one think about how precious health (and life) is
Quick easy read Hard to put down and very easy to read
Daughter loved the book and can't wait to see the movie
It was one of the most endearing books I have ever read
Love it Loved it Loves itSuch a wonderful book
I read it one sitting Loved it even through the tears
Like the book inside the book it ended quite abruptly
i bought this for my grandaughter she said she liked it
Wonderful read A beautiful love story between two teens
Awesome book and the movie was just as good as the book
A tough but true look at living with cancer  Great read
Ok but not really my kind of book I found it very sad
Loved loved this bookLook for joy in everything
Glad I read it so that I could discuss it with my niece
Loved it read it in one day but cried through the end
There was a sex scene but wasn't very vivid there is cussing and it can be boring at times But when the main character called 911 and said that her love of her life was dying from a malfunction from his g-tube to the operator I thought it was a little cheesy but it is an ok book
This book stole my life for two days because I absolutely could not put it down until I finished It really brings to light the importance of love and companionship during a time of suffering I shed some tears while I read but it was a privilege to have this book break my heart
This is my first time reading a book from John Green I thought it was a well written awesome book for people young and old Sad and inspiring deep and reflective This book gives all you all of the feels If you are considering purchasing this book don't hesitate buy it now
I liked this book sooo much John Green creates endings that make me think everything will be all right It was just a joke and everything will return to normal but it doesn't sometimes and that's what makes the book so awesome I would definitely recommend this to others
Green enters the teenage mind superbly with a warmth and compassion that's rarely conveyed I'm the father of a toddler and I really hope that I have the sort of relationship that the protagonist has with her parents Beautifully rendered as is the main love story of the plot
Words can not really exspress how good this book was It made me cry and laugh at times The story seemed so true that it riggered emotions I wish more authors would write tar jerkers like this one Besides Will Grayson Will Grayson this is one of Green`s best works
I can not wait to get this book I`m about to cry jut sitting here reading the reviews I`m deffinently going to nuy this book Impossible not to want to read it I don`t cry when reading a book or watching a movie but I`m pretty sure that will all change when I read this :`)
Book club choice - I enjoy a young adult novel now and then - but this one far exceeded my expectations  Don't be turned away by the sad topic - teenagers with terminal cancers - you'll find humor and LIFE in this story  It stayed with me for days after I finished reading it
Made me cry and appreciate life 10/10 would recommend
Good book sad and didn't expect the twist at the end
Great Book The ending kind of threw me off though Lol
wonderful book; great for all ages;  exquisite writing
Good read I loved the movie but enjoyed the book more
For the first time ever I enjoyed the movie more   
Loved it would have expanded on the ending a bit more
Amazing book  I cried and laughed and cried some more
EVEN IF YOU SEEN THE MOVIE READ THE BOOK SO MUCH BETTER
Great Book The ending kind of threw me off though Lol
John Green is not a girl Nor is he a girl with cancer
Enjoyable read easy read A little predictable though
Not horrible but not as great as everyone said it was
Couldn't put the book down Sad book but a good story
It was a great story how young adults cope with cancer
Excellent read Happy &amp; sad all at the same time 
One of the best books I've had the pleasure of reading
This book is amazing I recommend this book for anyone

It was a good book  I would recommend it to teenagers
Touching story that will make you cry at several parts
Soo worth reading Surprising intense and beautiful
Really enjoyed the book well written very quick read
My mother in law died of cancer before I knew my husband To glimpse a fictional possibility of their thoughts and feelings makes me feel as though I better understand the enormity of their hopeful/hopelessness Thank you Mr Green for sharing your gifts and talents with us
First of all The Fault in Our Stars is now by far my favorite book Pure genius amazingness  Also the Book Haven's shipping speed was surprisingly fast I got the book like two days after I ordered it and in perfect condition So overall awesome service great book
I was given this book as a gift and read it within two days I fell in love with the characters and felt the storyline provided a more honest portrayal of youth surviving cancer Such a great read I would recommend to anyone looking for an entertaining heart warming story
For the entire story I've felt that I was reading the stories of real people in real situations An enjoyable read about two teenagers that speaks to me far more than I expected especially since on the outside I am not of the same age nationality or afflictive condition
I loved this book  I was on a mission to read the 10 books being made into movies this year  This was one of those books  I didn't have any expectations and was so pleasantly surprised at how much I liked it  At the core this is a love story with a heartbreaking twist
when gus died i started crying so hard that i had to put the book down i was surprised when it ended thoughupdated review:i just finished reading this book for a second time and i have to say i fell even deeper in love with the story and the characters
There is not much to say about this book that has already been said My two cents: it feels completely authentic I loved the characters and while I did NOT need boxes of tissues my heart ached at the end This book moved me; I am so glad I took a chance on this YA novel
I loved the plot It had me laughing hysterically then flooding in tears It was really emotional and it was definitely a good read although it only lasted me 4 hours The covers are in great condition and i was especially impressed when I realized it was a signed copy
Given as a gift and I borrowed it back to read myself
I really enjoyed the humour despite the circumstances
really good quality perfect state Fantastic overall
Had NO clue what this book was about  A must read
This was a wonderful book It was sad but it was real
Loved everything about it def recommend it to others
The book was so much better than the movie Thumps up

I love this book I could read it over and over again
This was a gift to my daughter and she loves the book
Yes it's as compelling as almost everyone says it is

Great book  One of the best I've read in a long time
Fun book to keep me company as I drove across the USA
Great book very well written Hard to find these days
i loved it &lt;read it in one nite &gt; easy reading
I wasn't ready for that level of emotional commitment
Best book I've ever read Tragic but well written :)
Liked the book a tearjerker with a realistic story
Very good book Heartbreaking story of love and Cancer
A interesting sad but powerful story for young readers
Amazing story story about love sickness and tragedy
I lked the book very touching story and easy reading
A gem Philosophical witty emotional Real I cried
Good beach read - fast easy but beautifully written
Perfect Just what i was looking for and great service
I usually don't like romance novels but this one is just gosh words cannot describe the emotions running through me right now I've read this book about the times and every time I cry my eyes out This is my favorite book That is not a title I give out easily
I loved this book  It is a beautiful story of teenagers struggling with cancer and all its side effects while also going through normal ups and downs of growing up and falling in love  It couldn't put it down and read it in a day  And of coursethere were tears
It's been a long time since I've read such well-crafted prose in any genre let alone Young Adult  The plot is riveting the characters deep and well-developed  But the author's command of the written word is what ultimately makes this book such a delicious read
Still one of my favorite books Incredibly beautiful
I was so touching of this book and the movie as well
Read it instead of seeing the movie  Liked the book
I love this book It's so muck more than a love story
Such a good book I cried buckets but in a good way
This book grabs your heart from the beginning to end
Compassionate heady pithy and eminently quoteable
Found the book boring  Had to make myself finish it
really liked the bookbut the movie was better
I liked the story but at times it was hard to follow
OMG MY FAV book of all time             
Epic story No one tells a tale quite like John Green
Could not put this book down Read it in one sitting
Great engrossing read  Always have  tissues near by
The whole family loved the book It is an great read
An amazing book  It will pull at your heart strings
Now more than ever I am anxious to watch the movie
Very emotional yet beautiful book Very well written
This book was awesome Can't wait to watch the movie
typical love story with a twist of both having cancer

Easy to read but very touching Great summer reading
i loved this book &amp; plan on reading it a second time

Started out excellent but lost steam half way through
My current number 1 gift for teens John Green rocks
Loved this book Characters are amazing Well written
Very good book with a interesting change in the end
Exceptional- written very similarly to The Book Thief
Not a great read The story was weak and predictable
Awesome book about love and living All that matters
A bit depressing but very well written  Enjoyed it
I could not out this book down  Very very very good
Sweet story and an easy read  Could not put it down
A truly excellent book Definitely worth a few tears
It was so good  I kept wanting to read more and more
Absolutely loved this book Can't wait for the movie
Interesting right from the start  Very easy reading
Amazing book But the authors note was a huge letdown
Good weekend read-sad but uplifting at the same time
I absolutely feel in love with this book I loved the characters especially Hasel and I enjoyed her quirky personalitythe book was slightly sad so be prepared to cry a little or a lot but it is definitely worth it  I hope others enjoy this book as much as I did
This is the only book I have been able to read more than once Ever I have read it at least four times and I've listened to a reading of it twice now I was thinking the other night of using the colors from the cover and painting my room using those as inspiration
A terrifying reveal of death and its mark on life Full of the trauma of cancer in multiple manifestations as well as the emotional tailspin of new and undeniable star-crossed love Quick relatable honest It was also nice to be so very familiar with the setting
This was an emotional read that leaves one to ponder the realities of life for one facing a devastating battle with cancer  John Green uses phrases that enable the reader to visualize the characters and the unfortunate circumstances with which they are surrounded
Fantastic characters electric dialogue reread it from the start a week after initial reading because I loved keeping the company of characters so muchRecommended for readers of all ages - don't be put off by the young adult tag or you will miss out
The problem with this book is that Mr Green clearly does not give us hope as cancer patients how sad because he is missing the truth that joy is attainable through all circumstances  If you have cancer or know anyone who does please do not read this book
This is by far one of the best books I have ever read I must be honest and say that there were several words that I had NEVER heard that I had to look for a definition of That's kind of embarassing to admit But this book is excellent and I highly recommend it
My only regret was buying this as an e-book which led to me reading it at work one night and trying not to cry The characters are superbly developed the book is well written and it offers some great insight into life and love Buy it now you won't regret it
Such a well written novel Intelligent humorous and at times tragic It was the first novel I have read within a 24 hours period for atleast 10 years John Green pulls you into the story so much that when it's over you really don't know what to do with yourself
I absolutely adored this book It is now one of my favorites It was the second book to ever make me cry (And I've read a lot of books) Augustus and Hazel addict you before the first chapter ends A beautiful story of young love and strength It was incredible
just loved it i laughed i cried; just a great read
One of the best books written  I cried like a girl
Wonderful love story Must read for the avid reader
A very good book I'll look at others by John Green
wasnt as good as i had heard but a pretty good book
Such a tear jearker  Need to watch the movie now üíñ
Its a wonderful book and beats the movie hands down
I bought this for my granddaughter and she loved it
The book was a great read I loved the Gus character
Laughed and CriedAmazing Emotional Rollercoaster
Good book; entertaining; can't wait to see the film
Thought it was geared more toward juvenile audience
Wicked nice book - shipped quick  Daughter loves it
Wow Such an epic love story from such young souls
Great bookeasy read  Time to see the movie now
A beautifully written novel for young and old alike
both my son and daughter read the book and loved it
It was well written and very sensitive to our heart
The Book was so sad but it was a great book to read
truly enjoyed the characters and the author's style
Fantastic writing John Green I'm officially a fan
Loved this book  It truly lived up to all the hype
Although it was very sad to me it was a good story
Beautiful story Brought me to years multiple times
Good book but there wasn't a whole pile to the story
Wonderful book and movie Would recommend to anyone
A quick readbut get the tissues handy Loved it
easy to read   it made me cry a lot enjoyed it
Very sad Somewhat predictable But hard to put down
well written kept my attention throughout the book
Wonderfully written I loved reading this story
A Beautiful exciting and emotional roller coaster
Excellent book  Can't wait to watch the movie now
Incredibly well written and kept me totally engaged
Excellent story and writing A very worthwhile read
I love the fault in our stars thank u so much Amazon
Daughter read it in a week and she is not a reader
What a great book Just have a box of tissues ready
Such a great moving book bring some tissues though
Heart wrenching Beautiful Full of love and sarcasm
Excellent book  Great laughs and thought provoking
sentences a little involved for children that young
I absolutely adore this book It's funny and sarcastic but near the end I realized I fell in love with the characters and I could not stop crying It was beautifully written and I believe Hazel would be an inspiring girl to a cancer patient as Anna was to her
A friend urged me to read this book and the description sounded a bit depressing but she assured me that it wasn't  It's a tough topic but extremely well-written with insight and humor Although it's a YA novel it was one of the best I've read this year
Came upon this book without knowing much about it LOVED IT Raw funny insightful first love love story I have a 14 year old daughter who has been and a mother/child book group since she was in third grade This will definitely be on our book group list
I laughed I cried I underlined favorite lines  I couldn't put it down  John Green's use of language in Looking for Alaska and now in Fault is just brilliant  This will be a new favorite in my high school classroom library  Read it but bring the tissues
John's new book is like the review title says simply amazing He effectively fit the human experience into 313 pages You'll laugh you'll cry in fact you might actually laugh while you're crying The story of Hazel and Augustus is one that transcends time
The Portrayal  of what cancer can do to people especially young people seemed quite accurate this book actually would be a good learning tool for many in the medical profession to get them to understand some of the psychological effects cancer has on people
This book had me bawling in the last quarter of it It is an incredible read I honestly don't know how he could imagine up such an incredible love story of some cancer patients but it was incredible This is a must read book You won't want to put it down
Few books make me want to underline passages in them Perhaps life's situations make books speak louder at times than others  But at this moment this book spoke to me and left me speechless May it hopefully do the same for you I'm betting it will Enjoy
This is one of those books that will stay with long after reading No Hazel and Gus dont talk like teenagers but if ¬†youre harping on that then you are missing the point This is a beautiful book meant to challenge your view of the world A rare book indeed
This novel is very well written with very real and quotable characters  If it was not on my Kindle I would have had my highlighter out and sticky tabs because there is quite a lot of wisdom in a small package and much heart  Bravo for a truly amazing book
This is my favorite book by far It was like I was watching a movie rather than reading a book It has fought me so many lessons and helped me find myself in a way nothing else could It has spoken to me like no other book has I highly recommend this book
The author grabs your attention and keeps you drawn in I loved this book and read it all in one sitting It will make you laugh and the end will make you cry like a baby Look forward to reading more books by this author Buy it- you won't be disappointed
The only problem I have with this book is that it is marketed as a 'YA' book which I think does it a great disservice  I am a 57 year old PhD educated male - I say this NOT to impress but to simply indicate I am NOT anywhere near the demographic this book is being marketed to - and yet I would say it is perhaps in the top ten of my favorite books of all time  When I think YA I inevitably think of 'Twilight' and other non-literature of that ilk (I am sorry if that offends anyone - I honestly tried to read 'Twilight' but could only stomach 3 pages)  This is YA in the sense that 'To Kill a Mockingbird' is YA - and yes it IS that good After reading this I insisted my 89 year old mother read it and she loved it as well I am not ahamed to say that I cried for several minutes after reading the final page - and if you can make it through without doing the same I pity you  Some people claim this book is depressing but I found it uplifting and not at all downbeat - in fact I also laughed out loud many times reading it  This is my first John Green book but I am eagerly looking forward to reading his entire back catalog So no matter your age or other defining characteristics just do yourself a favor and pick up this book immediately - you won't be sorry
Funny beartbreaking and absolutely amazing story
Good easy read which you don't have to think about

Love writing style story &amp; interesting vocabulary
Great book very quick  read and a wonderful story
Delightful story great dialogue Very much enjoyed
Great Book  Sad but heartwarming at the same time
This book really just felt good to read you know The characters feel incredibly real and you feel like you might actually meet them This is a good book to pick up unless you absolutely hate romance Then you probably shouldn't be looking at this book
The premise and storyline behind this book is really good and the author is an excellent writer Too badthen that he has completely missed the true meaning of suffering This could have been an amazing story but is really just another book on the shelves
Maybe its because I too had a boyfriend with cancer that I related to this book in a way which kept me turning page after page What a heartbreaking inspiring hilarious and smart read this was Loved loved loved the characters and everything about it
His best book yet  John Green has once again created two in-depth characters as only he can  Hazel and Augustus are mature beyond their years as they deal with what life had handed them  Both funny and tragic you won't be able to put this book down
The girl I gave this too likes it a lot I did not read this but the teenager that did commented that I had given her the best and the worst book all in one  She had tears in her eyes just at the end of reading it  It made me want to read it as well
Recommended so highly by my students I knew I had to read this book  Now I see what they mean The characters are so quirky and relatable; I couldn't help but fall in love with them even though from the start I knew they might not make it to the end
Read this after a recommendation from a friend and am so glad I did  Definitely the best book I have read in a long while  Written with humour and tenderness and larger-than-life characters that still ring true  Do yourself a favour and pick it up
They Sting But They Also Bring Honey  - The Slow Train To RishikeshRest assured buy the fault in our stars It's a gentle whisper to your ears that will cure all sickness in life I do not want to spoil the book for you by saying more
A humbling story where life is lived to the fullest to the end ¬† ¬†fate is excepted as the circle of life getting the priorities right I look forward to reading more from John GreenI don‚Äòt give 5 stars often but this deserves reward for ‚Äúwell done‚Äú
This is such a great book I couldn't put it down
Very well written I couldn't put this book down
I enjoyed the book so much  It was heart warming

This IS ONE OF THE MOST AMAZING BOOKS OUT TODAY
Bought as a gift it came quickly at an OK price-
A beautiful story told beautifully  A great read
Good book --a realpage turner Sad at some points
Why did he have to die But this book taught me that even though you have cancer and if your going to die its okay As long as there are people there for you people who love you This book taught me a lot of things so much that I can't explain it
I really don't get it It's like the notebook with cancer instead of memory loss and old age Is this really what passes for literary excellence now
This book is written so wonderfully it's actually kind of hard for me to explain I laughed out loud gasped and cried and it was all in one amazingly written immensely captivating book It is definitely definitely now one of my top five books
I bought this book for a trip where I'd get some time to actually read I was pretty disappointed The dialog between the young characters wasn't believable and the storyline itself--not the characters--was shallow It didn't live up to it's hype
I wasn't sure what to expect when I first downloaded this book I saw it on the Best seller list and thought why not This book encompassed all my feelings It made me laugh cry excited and saddened me Overall this was an amazing read
What a great experience to read this book  It is for everyone - not just young people  Hazel and Augustus are young true but wise way beyond their years  I laughed out loud and cried too  I was sad when it was finished  Perfection Read it
Rarely is there a book that so effortlessly allows you to feel every spectrum of emotion  You will have tears of laughter heartbreak and loss  A wonderful book with characters and  stories that will stay with you for weeks after the last page
Being a college student I have no time to actually sit down and enjoy a good book  I found myself reading this in 10-minute intervals in between class and sometimes ignoring lectures just to read on  It was cute funny sad makes you think
The fault in Our Stars was one of the most beautiful books I have ever read  John is such an amazing author he makes you feel connected to the characters like no other author can  This was by far his best book  I recommend this toeveryone
When I first read the book (I have the book too many times to count) I fell in love with Hazel and Augustus They beautiful poeple inside and out I will never forget this book Thanks John for writing an unbelievabley horriblely great book
Heartbreaking emotional read Its a must read
Really enjoyed the book Recommend it to everyone
Great for middle-school reluctant or non-readers
Loved it cant' wait to see the movie to compare
An awesome tale of two teenagers who fell in love
It was just an overall strange book Not my style
Tear jerker for sure Loved the movie adaptation
It was a good book Kept me wanting more answers
So amazing Not enough words for it's brilliance
The story was pretty good a little slow at times
My daughter is a John Green fan  TFIOS fandom
interesting  a bit contrived but worth reading
Great book daughter loves it too  a Tear-jerker
Beautiful story Did not end as i expected it to
One of the best books I have read in a long time

He writes well in this book and very true to life
Beautifully written and keep your Kleenex out
It's amazing Get over yourself and read it
This book proves that love does not discriminate
Wonderful book very powerfulll and inspirational
Super-fast read Nice story with nice characters
I just finished rereading this book for the seventh time and cried through the whole thing It is life-changing It is relatable and real and witty and the best book I have ever read My first born son will be named Augustus That's a promise
This book was not my favorite The main character had almost no emotion through out the entire book and then at the end she suddenly got a heart
A beautiful story encompassing the meaning of life the sureness of death and the wonders of young love  Although the reader roots for the characters to live and love the outcome is inevitable Gripping but sad Certainly thought provoking
If there were more books like THE FAULT IN OUR STARS then I wouldn't feel the need to look for a boyfriend I could just snuggle up on my couch reading about Augustus and Hazel and be perfectly happy Ah what do I read now I am at a loss :(
Hazel really is a wonderful person The author really got you into the book and the characters then hit  you hard with the ending  You don't get to choose if you get hurt but you choose who hurts you and hazel and Gus chose how they wanted
I cannot I simply cannot This book it just I want the characters I do I want them But such is life and I can't have them This book is amazing and I applaud John Green for creating it and adding a little more beauty to the world
Loved it Beautiful writingenjoy the story
Good writing  Wasn't impressed with the ending

Excellent book bought for High School Exercise
I read this for a bookclub as I normally would not read a YA title It was a wonderful story that made me smile laugh and really cry Have a box of tissues by your side I loved it and was happy it was the selected title by my co-worker
I could not put this book down I adored the characters They were very real and possessed qualities that I wish I had myself The story of their love is touching and I was honored to be included You will not regret purchasing this book
This book made me ache I refuse to visit certain places because I am a coward As luck would have it I took a quick peek in and enjoyed the language so much that I committed I encourage all fellow chickens to do the same It's worth it
I choose my five stars because this book is the best book I've ever read it's sad however folks yoU with joy due tho the fact that they did truly love each other this by far is my favorite book I've ever read thank you John green
Amazingly well written but at the same time a quick read for experienced readers I laughed I cried I loved it Definitely worth the price and more a really different take on a love story Recommend this to readers of any genre enjoy
This is honestly one of the greatest books I have ever experienced A story about love and the human condition it will have you laughing through tears If you are looking for the next modern classic I strongly suggest you pick this up
Beautiful book with a great story line I like the book's twist on a love story it's definitely not average but it's awesome Fell in love with many of the characters and enjoyed every single page of it I'm dying to watch the movie
This is my new favorite book John Green is an amazingly talented writer and this book proves it There are so many memorable lines in this book and the characters are amazing This book made me laugh cry and want to read it again

Well written Found myself yelling at the book
Fantastic read Get ready to cry your eyes out
ove it   a must read for everyone of all ages
This book was as good or better than the movie
Sad in the end but definitely kept my attention
Very shallow book Too fictional for my liking
This was a lovely story with a likeable voice
shipping and handling was on point as expected
Good book it was actually stolen by my daughter
Predictable  Movie may be better in this case
Great book very emotional and filled with love
beautiful story filled with fun and compassion
Honestly an amazing and unforgettable novel
A well written tear jerker with a twist ending
Beautiful story Well written and an easy read
I talked to both places great really enjoyed it
Seriously you really need tissue for this book
The story was little to contrived for my taste
This book will make you laugh and make you cry
I thought with all the hype it would be better
I loved it One of my best reading experiences
Beautifully written A hope-filled tear-jerker
Very good book  I enjoyed it very much
One of the best books I've read in a long time
Could read it again and again Actually I did
Well written insightful and humorous at times
Good book  Glad i read before i saw the movie
Not a book you should get really excited about
Saw the movie first Enjoyed both a great deal
This book is amazing  Everyone should read it
Very emotional and touching story A must read
Extremely engaging but get out your tissue box
I had to read this seemed like a lot of hype about howgreat this book was  It was ok excellantly written butmaybe it was just to sad for me  I'm giving it to my twoteenage granddaughters to see what they think
I found the story line and characters interesting but I found the language totally unnecessary and offensive  It may be how high school students speak today but it was offensive to me and I finally put the book down because of it
I thought it was a very well written book  It was incredibly sad with a brilliant humorous thread running throughout the story  And a wonderful love story A great book for anyone grappling with serious illness and the hereafter
This review won't be long or very intelligent but I really felt the need to say how much I loved this book  You easily connected to the characters and what they are going through  This is the first book I ever cried while reading
This book is an appropriately irreverent amalgamation of humor tragedy wit and prose Gorgeously written with delightful tidbits of insight and raw open slices of reality this book is well worth every second it takes to read
Although the book is based on the sadness of teenagers with cancer I felt the book was entertainingand well written  I would recommend it to anyone who just wants to sit back relax and enjoya snuggle with a good book
This book is by far my favorite John Green book It is so wonderfully written It is funny and touching and has so many great thoughts and quotes Set aside an full day to read this in one sitting you will not want to put it down
Thought provoking and rich with witty humor The Fault in Our Stars is so far my favorite read of the year The characters were dynamic and colorful while not being overwritten and almost over-the-top as some authors have become
While I have a soon to be 13 year old I'm not a reader of Young Adult fiction but saw this on the Amazon best books of January 2012 and it sounded like a worthile read  Wow  Wow  This is about as good as any fiction gets and categorizing it as Young Adult presumably because of the age of the characters vastly undersells the power emotion and quality of this amazing novel  The story is about teenage cancer victims Hazel and Augustus their struggle with the insidiousness of cancer their mortality and their love of each otherThis book will make you laugh and cry will make you think about friends and family who've had cancer or other terminal diseases will cause you to feel blessed for your own healthy children and cause you to think about your own mortality  The Fault in our Stars connects at a visceral level through amazingly real characters and a simple love story  John Green has written a remarkable story that deserves to be read by as broad an audience as possible  This definitely makes the list of top 10 books I have read over the last 10 years  Please read this book it is that special
Well written Well developed characters  Recommended for young readers but I was curious because of it's notoriety  I was not disappointed I laughed I cried (a lot) and I loved these characters  I highly recommend this book
John Green has become my favorite author I pre-ordered this hardback to fill out my collection and aim to have all of his books eventually I only lack a couple nowThis book arrived fast and in new condition as described
A 'young adult' book full of serious thems handled with a delicate funny and insightful appreciation of challenges these teens face  Such a sad topic handled so beautifully this should not be limited to the young adult crowed
Wonderful heartbreaking funnysadenlightening encouraging eye opening I could go on and onWhat a fantastic book loved it Read it in one sitting This story will stay with me for a longlong time Thank youMr Green
A page turner Well-written with extremely likeable characters My only quibbles likely relate to my not being used to the pace and plotting of YA fiction but that's my issue I imagine the book's intended audience will love it
Interesting I was flipping through the pages
I is a very touching book I really enjoyed it
Such a great read Would definitely recommend
Very nice read Would recommend to any reader
I am not a huge reader and I LOVED  THIS BOOK
Liked the movie so much I had to get the book
It helped me understand cancer a little better
This novel simply grabbed me and never let go
The book was goodnot greatbut worth reading
It was a good read can't wait to see movie now
It was very moving and I loved the characters
This book was a page turner I really liked it
This book was very good So sad but very good
enjoyed this book didn't care for the ending
Great book I am looking forward to the movie
Great story but needed more for the ending :-(
Had a good plot twist but hard to get started
A bit too anti-establishment but a good story
AwesomeVery sensitive and beautiful
Received it earlier than expected Very happy
A love story about two dying teens Wonderful
It was a really good book I cried like a baby
Very easy reading - might watch the movie now
Great book And the movie actually follows it
This was a gift for my niece and she loved it
LOVED this book  A beautifully written story
12 yr old loves it and we both loved the movie
Loved it from the first page to the last page
Humorous wrenching and beautifully perceptive
TOUCHING IF ONLY WE ALL HAD A LOVE LIKE THAT
It was good but a little youthful for my taste
I feel the events in the book are very rushed
A must read especially if you loved the move
Wonderful story Very sad Have tissues handy
A bit predictable in places but a nice read
The ending was not what I expected Good read
Excellent book Can't wait to see the movie
Story drags on a bit without making an impact
Great read I cried a lot but it was worth it
found it tedious at times just didn't love it
Great book Couldn't put it down A must read
I loved each character and was sorry it ended
Absolutely loved it  Read in less than a day
It came very fast and in good quality love it
As a 15 year old girl this story was absolutely intoxicating It made me laugh and it made me cry The humorous relationships between characters add a new twist to society's perception on teens with cancer Highly recommended
I found this book so nicely written along with a cute story plot I enjoyed the difference in the characters along with their personalities I was broken hearted at some parts but anyone would be delighted with this book Okay
Love this book love the characters  Well written to display smart witty and somewhat sarcastic characters  For such a tough topic I actually found myself laughing out loud on a few occasions I highly recommend this book
Great Book I read it in just a few days and found myself fairly connected with the characters I did think that it ended a little abruptly but that's probably how it is supposed to feel given the main topics and storylines
Okay so I got this book the other day and I could not put it down It is 313 pages and I read it in three days Seriously this was the best book I have ever read :) I highly reccomend it and I think EVERYONE should read it
I have read all of John Green's books and this is by far the best  I didn't love Looking for Alaska or An Abundance of Katherines- but The Fault in Our Stars was brilliant  Well-written and witty I recommend it to any age
I absolutely loved this book It's believable and a quick read I was quite upset when the book ended just because I hated that being the last I'd know of both Hazel and Augustus You will not regret getting/reading this book
If you enjoy funny people with witty retorts gallows quips and passages of Profound dialogues about the Meaning of Life then this book is for you  To be honest it was an enjoyable read the way a television sitcom can be an enjoyable laugh-your-cares-away kind of thing  Whilst reading this I thought to myself Hm--Shonda Rimes might want to hire this John Green and add him to her production writers group  Every character was (maybe not the momshm) articulate and witty and profound  That to me equals author-is-louder-than-story because the characters are merely mediums for his I-am-so-funny-I-kill-myself writing  And yes I am jealous that he is so funny and clever  And yes I did enjoy such cleverness however it was John Green's voice saying these funny things and because I couldn't get the guy out of the picture in my head it kept the read from being anywhere close to that third dimension or what-have-you  So truly I should give it two stars but I inadvertently gave it five stars on my mobile device so I want to try to balance that out somewhat
I cannot stop thinking about this book It is one of the best books I have read in a very long time and I wish it kept going on and on I just finished it 2 days ago and Im re-reading it alreadyNerdfighters forever
I thoughly enjoyed this book  I rarely find a book that I can't put down but that I don't want to finish because I am enjoying it so much and I don't want it to end  It was such a mix of humor and painAn amazing book
Very teenager book but great for those ages
Be prepared to cry your eyes out Great book
Couldn't put it down Read it all in a night

Well-written and keeps you turning the pages
I cant say enough about this book LOVED IT
Beautifully written a truly heartfelt story
Best book I've ever read It did make me cry
was very good I enjoyed it cried at the end
Excellent Very touching story Well written
One of the best teen novels you will ever read; though be warned it is very sad I used a box of tissues The characters have depth and John Green leaves you wanting more at the end which is what any good novel should do
I'm not much of a reader but after watching a lot of vlogbrothers on Youtube and hearing John read the second chapter of this book I decided to get it I read the whole thing in one day because it was just that awesome
Be prepared before you read this storyThis is no rainy Sunday afternoon sleepy novel this is an intense journey  And like all hard things you are very well rewardedThis book is amazing but be prepared
I wanted to love this book but did not Could not get past the 16 and 17 year old characters talking and acting like they were 30
John Green is never a disappointment I like the way he was able to have me so incredibly sad and then drag a laugh out of me He has a talent for words that seep into your soul and stay with you I recommend it for sure
This book was simply amazing I love John Green because not only does he write novels that attract young adults but the themes that are shown in the books are much more in depth than a regular young adult novel Superb
It wasn't as good as I thought it was going to be after watching John read the first two chapters on YouTube but it was still a great book Great value for the price (I got mine for $899) especially since it is signed
I just finished the book and all I have to say is WOW From start to finish the book was written beautifully I highly recommend this book to any literature lover Please take a small amount of  your time and read this
I loved it I laughed I cried and it really made me think I've never been so taken aback by a character I love how real everybody felt The plot was tiny but enough to carry you through the relatively short book =)
This book is too amazing to even put into words  John Green's ability to bring characters to life is shown in this impeccable novel  It is by far the best book I have ever read and I recommend to everyone to read it
Ugh This book was so hard to get through Since I'd started it at my daughter's request I had to finish it Unrealistic characters and equally unrealistic dialog Hated it I fail to see the attraction to any reader
I really enjoyed this book  I was hesitant that it would be sad the entire way through but I loved its perspective  I believe that this book takes a real life approach and is most definately not too sappy
I GOT IT AS A GIFT FOR MY GIRLFRIENDShe laughed she cried originally saw it on tumblr so I decided to surprise her by ordering it as a gift Shipped faster than expected definitely suggest as a good read
I do not need to write a review of what countless others have said before me  It is a wonderful story both heartbreaking and bittersweet  It is the first book that I have started reading again as soon as I finished
The fault in our stars is a really good book
Eh It wasn't as good as the publicity hype
The fault in our stars is a wonderful story
Very good perspective on a very sad subject
Loved it amazing book great author :) &lt;3

I loved this book It's such an easy one to read (English is not my first language - I'm from Brazil which means I speak Portuguese - and yet it was pretty easy and it took me less than a week to finish reading it)
there are some books that are worth every cent you spent on them TFIOS is one of those books John Green does it again this books is simply magic Yes it is heartbreaking but it is always hilarious and thoughtful
I love the thoughts of dear hazel she the transformation she went through She became a totally different person all because if Augustus Amazing book I would recommend it to anyone Beautifully written John green
It pained my heart so much I just do not want anyone going through this like I have It feels personal Great read Heart aching I love and hate it all the way till the end I miss the characters Will never forget
John Green did an excellent job writing this book I was skeptical about reading it at first because some of the reviews States that there was no plot Some stories are just that &amp; I think this is onea great one
This was a fantastic read I cannot see why it took me so long to start reading it Overall it took me about 85 hours to read between work and home I recommend this to anyone who enjoys a good first person story
This book is amazingIt's full of love and compassion two things I love in a bookI love it I just loved it I hope there is another or I could read it all over againThe fault in our stars is amazing
This book was amazing I could not put it down It was nice to see love this real and raw It was so emotional in a good way This is a book that makes you really appreciate life and what you have A stunning book

Loved this novel I cried and I laughed once on two adjoining pages A wonderful story that I will share with my daughter Sort of feel like returning to Amsterdam Amazing and will read over and over again
I bought this book for my 16 year old daughter after reading a review in a magazine She loved the book so I thought I would read it as well  Read it in one day  Couldn't put it down  I loved the characters
Great read couldn't put it down The writer deals beautifully with the sensitive issue of teenagers coping with terminal cancer Life goes on and they still have their dreams Not in any way morbid or morose
I ordered this book only a few hours ago and I have already finished it This is by far one of the best books I have ever read It is very well written and just a touching story I only wish it were a series
As a mother of a child who passed away of a congenital heart defect I was able to relate to this author's portrayal of so many familiar emotions and the truth he portrayed as families face an inevitable end
pick up this book and read it but only if you are a person who yearns for a book you cannot put down It has you living in the characters world and becoming intertwined with her realities Amazing John Green
This was a really beautiful book  I was the slightest bit disappointed in the ending because I didn't feel as if I got enough closure  But otherwise this was an awesome book that really resonated with me
If you've never read a book that‚Äôs made you laugh cry or feel mass amounts of happiness and anger all in one then The Fault In Our Stars is the PERFECT book for you to read From start to finish John Green pulls every emotion out of you with the love of Hazel and Augustus Waters From the beginning we‚Äôre introduced to Hazel and we learn that she has cancer When she attends a support group she meets Augustus and her whole life changes Page after page the words flow endlessly with the beauty of their love It‚Äôs enviable to not fall in love with each of the characters yourself as you read I‚Äôve read this book a total of 15 times since it came out in January of 2012 The most recent time that I read this book was when I was feeling as if my life wasn't working out and just really wasn't coming together the way I wanted it to I always turn to reading when things get hard and the book that I've found the most comforting was The Fault In Our Stars My life at the time seemed to be falling apart and being able to completely loose myself in the book was so overwhelmingly peaceful The plot and all the characters and emotions that John Green used filled me with the thought that reality isn't always what fixes things Sometimes it‚Äôs getting lost in a good book Given that I've read this book so many times it‚Äôs made a lasting impact on my life I can remember the first time I read it and how many times I laughed out loud or balled my face off at two in the morning I couldn't put it down I lost so much sleep just trying to loose myself more into the book After I finished it I couldn't believe what I‚Äôd read and how gorgeous it was to read every single word of the 336 pages that my favorite story entailed I would very highly suggest ANYONE to read this book It‚Äôs phenomenal from beginning to end and really ropes you in to falling in love with not only the characters and John Green but the love for reading-Rainah G
Now I read this in three days I just ate it up My first John Green book My favorite book For a while It isn't anymore And then all of a sudden people start to read it There is a bang heard across the world as millions of people pick up The Fault in Our Stars The popularity of such a book pains an inner geek that is also an outer one I have something to sayDon't get me wrong I almost like this book But I don't love it And you might not eitherThe popularity of this book bothers me because all at once everyone loved it I'm not saying you don't but hear me outThe Fault in Our Stars has so much popularity that people just automatically think it is good I'm not saying that it's bad or that people are just faking their love for it I'm not I feel like everyone loves it so much that everyone reads it and pictures it to be this perfect great amazing thing they understand perfectly I believe that this book is loved so much by so many that no one except a few can see the truth about it You don't love it You can't tell me why it's so great can you You can't tell meI can tell you why Because everyone thinks so I don't think that followers are the case I think that everyone is too blinded by the love for this book that exists to see what they truly think I think that loving this book is branded as a cultural norm that no one can see I believe that unless you truly think that this book isn't your favorite in the world only then you can like it because people need to except how it isn't perfect I love John Green Hardcore Nerdfighter all the way But Paper Towns with its true story and characters and An Abundance of Katherines with it's stubborn protagonist and plot lines and depth are both much betterI also dislike this book because there are no characters In this book they say they fear cancer books THIS IS A CANCER BOOK If you take away the cancer there are no characters I don't care if you talk about AIA or how they were in love AIA IS A BOOK HAZEL NEVER WOULD'VE LIKED IF SHE DIDN'T HAVE CANCER THEY MET AND BONDED BECAUSE OF CANCERTell me one thing left about the depths of these characters They have cancer andI hope this opens your eyes a bit Thanks for reading
I'll preface this by saying I feel like a jerk giving this two stars I expected to like it I often like books that are super popular and then experience a round of trashing from the haters (Most notably I liked The Hunger Games despite the buzz and subsequent smackdown) But    here we are Two starsIt wasn't poorly written or anything though you'll see soon why I disliked it As a story and mostly as executed it might have been three stars But the reason I decided on two stars instead of three is that I personally did not enjoy the book due to the overwhelming fakeness I felt around the characters (Your mileage may vary)No one was believable to me--mostly a voice issue but sometimes even the plot felt hollow--and that interfered mightily with my experience reading it I didn't love anyone I didn't feel authenticity from anyone I feel like if I were these kids' age and I went to school with them or socialized with them I'd be wondering the whole time when they were going to take their costumes off or stop reading lines and when I found out they weren't going to stop I'd just kinda quietly leave the group and hang out with people I didn't feel were pretending to be someone elseBut let's start with the good about the book I did really appreciate that cancer was not at all romanticized (though the book almost became self-congratulatory about its own failure to inspirationalize the characters--the narration literally pointed out its own grittiness like look look what I did did you see when the character puked and wet the bed look how REAL this is)Green also did a good job showing how illness affects different people in the characters' lives: the platitudes people post on social media for people who are having catastrophic surgery or dying from a disease; the way parents' and friends' and romantic partners' identity is transformed by the illness of their loved ones; the way people with cancer themselves may feel guilty about causing pain and pull away from those who love them in hopes of minimizing the damage That was all presented well and mostly properly nuanced An especially good scene included a character sharing his pain over a girlfriend dumping him expressing that being together for fourteen months before a sudden breakup was devastating and an insensitive nurse made light of it by saying fourteen months was nothing and he'd bounce back People telling you your life doesn't really suck very much because they have a different perspective is a lovely little invalidating thing people do to young people all the time and I appreciated the realismAnd also sometimes the turns of phrase were quirky and amusing; Hazel's reference to how her lungs sucked at being lungs was kinda funny and she names her oxygen tank Philip because it kinda looks like a Philip Silly stuff like that made me smile a little and I did laugh when someone suggested the blind guy could make his screen reader read him porn in a German man's accent That's the kind of thing we would have joked about in high school Green also did a good job not making Hazel a complete stereotype of a nerdy girl; yes she likes to read and isn't cool (and even points out that she is PROUD of not knowing what's cool) but she does watch a lot of junk television (I am not clear on why she likes America's Next Top Model but I'm okay without justification for her interests)Hazel's obsession with a novel's mysterious ending was interesting (and it was cool how she spread it to Augustus after which they shared their curiosity for similar reasons) I liked this aspect of the book and I liked that the author they were obsessed with did not have all the answers and epiphanies to their lives The whole I need to find out what happens to these characters bit was set up somewhat like they would get a happy ending if they could resolve this unknown but happily the book did not reduce itself to one dimension in that respectAnd yet I couldn't forgive it for several reasons and nearly all of them had to do with the way the characters expressed themselves or were treated by the narration Most notably the dialogue was awful The dialogue throughout for every character in every situation was some of the most pretentious and unbelievable stuff I've ever read You can't read it out loud without feeling like you're reciting and this isn't just the occasional moment of insight from a haunted cancer child with an old soul It's every dang person in the book 24/7 with the notable exception of when Green writes very young children whose dialogue is simplified also to the point of unreality (I have a pet peeve about child dialogue done wrong I could deal with Gus has a GIRLfriend LOL from his cousins I could not deal with the ensuing LOL she has BOOBIES nonsense It was contrived Like yeah little boys often think boobs are funny But the crass honesty of little children was somehow not captured here I couldn't hear it)Let's talk about this dialogue Okay so I was a geeky kid Big reader huge vocabulary used a lot of complicated words and phrases In college I had some pretentious friends I did Folks who literally referred to themselves as real poets (lifted from one of their profiles of yore: but not in a s***ty def jam kind of way; think Yeats Eliot Joyce THAT kind of poet) Folks who translated their poem titles into Latin just because they thought it added weight Folks who sat around underage-drinking their Guinness and comparing their own road trips Across State Lines to the trials and tribulations of Kerouac My clove-smoking open-mic-reading English major friends with literary references on their worn tee shirts didn't even talk like thisI'm saying I know the type and the dialogue in this book is a really painful exaggeration of it It's a big part of why I could not swallow what these people were about If you meet a dude who walks around with unlit cigarettes in his mouth because oh don't you see it's a metaphor You put the killing thing right between your teeth but you don't give it the power to do its killing I mean how do you not punch that guy in the throatYou still bought the cigarettes and gave your money to the cancer company Augustus How symbolic does it feel nowThe same dude's way of explaining why he got tired of basketball went as follows:I couldn't figure out why I was methodically tossing a spherical object through a toroidal object It seemed like the stupidest thing I could possibly be doingAnd I mean it's not just the main characters who do this Even the cabbie in a foreign country busts out with Some tourists think Amsterdam is a city of sin but in truth it is a city of freedom And in freedom most people find sin What Who talks like thatDo you want to know how Hazel reacted when she thought Augustus was a smoker Yes this is dialogueYou just ruined the whole thing The whole thing where a boy who is not unattractive or unintelligent or seemingly in any way unacceptable stares at me and points out incorrect uses of literality and compares me to actresses and asks me to watch a movie at his house But of course there is always a hamartia and yours is that oh my God even though you HAD FREAKING CANCER you give money to a company in exchange for the chance to acquire YET MORE CANCER Oh my God Let me just assure you that not being able to breathe SUCKS Totally disappointing TotallyDefinitely sounds like an emotional outburst yes 'KayIn the cancer survivors group her way of commenting on fear of oblivion is the following:There will come a time when all of us are dead All of us There will come a time when there are no human beings remaining to remember that anyone ever existed or that our species ever did anything There will be no one left to remember Aristotle or Cleopatra let alone you Everything that we did and built and wrote and thought and discovered will be forgotten and all of this will have been for naught Maybe that time is coming soon and maybe it is millions of years away but even if we survive the collapse of our sun we will not survive forever There was time before organisms experienced consciousness and there will be time after And if the inevitability of human oblivion worries you I encourage you to ignore it God knows that's what everyone else doesI'm definitely convinced that Hazel is sixteen and just a little intellectual aren't youI'll spare you the words Augustus chooses for his love confessionI don't have a problem with teenagers--especially intellectual bookish ones--having ideas like these Kids are freakin' smart and can be quite deep The words they chose for their messages however almost always felt so contrived and posed    and because of this I always felt like someone was standing there with cue cards or like I was listening to people reciting memorized speeches not speaking from their hearts (Interestingly enough there WAS one part where a character was reciting what turned out to be a memorized speech and there was not a difference between how he spoke during that and how he normally spoke in the novel)Furthermore until the protagonist introduced herself as Hazel I thought I was reading the words of a male character and she continued to read as masculine to me whenever the narrative would bump up against explicit contradictions to this She made a comment about how it frustrated her that boys are always making us watch their movies even though we girls don't LIKE those movies ugh we don't make them watch OUR movies whyyyy and that just felt like a bid for authenticity that didn't work She made a weird comment about how boys don't notice when the bra and panties don't match and some other stuff that just    made me feel like stereotypes were invoked here and there to try to make Hazel read like more of a girl but most of the time they just jarred because she generally didn't read like a girlThe thing is their dialogue didn't make me dislike them as characters usually It made me dislike the choices their author made about how to write them They never felt like people to me They just felt like constructions with deliberate planning even though a lot of what they described were clearly things people have felt and could feel There was a strange disconnection between the beautiful and terrible experiences the author described and the characters who were feeling themThe disconnection also manifested in other ways Green gives Hazel a friend from her pre-diagnosis days and she was seemingly pretty much just a tool for showing the reader how alienated Hazel had become from the normal world Kaitlyn is in school (unlike Hazel) and likes shopping and has a peculiar need to meet at the mall at 3:32 (suggesting some random overscheduledness in her life which proceeds to not affect her desire to shop for hours) and I am puzzled as to what these two had in common before disease put Hazel in a different worldAnd though Green did a very good job maintaining the moment-by-moment realities of living with her kind of cancer (never letting the narrative forget that Hazel can't run has to drag her oxygen tank around will require untangling from tubes if you kiss her etc) there were other strange echoes of not-quite-connection Hazel's a vegetarian At one point she's randomly protesting why breakfast food is relegated to breakfast time And then she's really excited that in a foreign country the meal that's delivered contains deli meat (Presumably she's just excited that they aren't adhering to breakfast food and it didn't say she ate it but her being excited about lunch meat when her objection to eating meat is moral seems odd without more explanation)I also frequently felt that the author was simply *not actually picturing* the scenes playing out because I couldn't see the characters doing the things they described doing the same as he apparently wasn't imagining people actually speaking the words he wrote for them (unless he WANTED all his characters to be people we all kind of want to throat-punch)Narration is also always telling me things I hate the SHOW DON'T TELL overly prescriptive writing advice as much as anyone but I felt like recommending it a lot Whenever Hazel started narrating about how she likes her mom but wants time alone or how people think about her friend's demeanor and accent when said people are not there or that she doesn't feel attracted to the love interest in the way she expected to and then later well now narration says she does it again feels more like some third person is telling us the story rather than its being told by the person going through it Sometimes we're connected to her thoughts and seeing through her eyes and sometimes it feels more like she knows she's a character or that she has an audienceThen there were just a few problems I had with how certain characters and concepts were presented Most notably Isaac At one point he's having an emotional meltdown and the other two characters in the room are kind of joking around or playing off it which made it feel oddly cartoonish like an animated villain character bawling in the background beating the ground in defeat while the heroes have their laugh before the iris out And later when he's learning to live as a blind person the blindness is presented really oddly He becomes really helpless and though of course he is newly blind so some of that is expected he also appears unable to do things I can assure you I can do with my eyes closed People guide him into chairs by gripping his shoulders and treat him like he's incapable of anything at all At one point Hazel on her oxygen tank and living with late-stage cancer claims to feel weird about being the healthiest person in the room when Isaac was there despite that Isaac is now cancer-free and not incapacitated in any way besides being blind Very weird how the book spent so much energy on highlighting the I don't want your pity angle of being a cancer patient and yet Isaac's blindness is regarded so negatively by the othersAnd this is more a character flaw that's realistic rather than a character flaw that's the fault of writing I don't like but I was immediately irritated when Hazel implied that it's creepy and obsessive for an unattractive boy to stare at you but it was different that THIS boy was doing it because he was HOT after all I know there are girls like that but this made her feel really petty to me and I would have rather that not been so explicitly stated Hot dudes get away with things not-so-hot dudes can't get away with and I'm totally complicit in supporting this double standard is not an admirable perspective for meAnd some of the ragging they did on religious people implying they're not very smart and/or are dippy kinda bothered me even though I'm not religious myself Seemed elitist to me Like a lot of the rest of the bookI was also surprised that when Hazel's favorite author mentioned that her generation is afflicted with having Internet obsession instead of brains she doesn't react negatively at all Maybe she was just too busy being a fangirl over getting a communication from the author she idolizes but wow that guy is an ass (There was your warning sign there Hazel though I imagine if he'd made an exception for you you would have eaten it up because you don't seem to mind your generation getting insulted as long as you're acknowledged to Not Be Like Them)What else The references annoyed me References often annoy me in YA books because they make me think adults are trying to relate to the kids It wasn't OMG ladies get the look that gets the hunks bad but I do wonder what drives these authors to select timely references that will surely be dated by the time the thing is publishedOverall the whole OMG I'm so glad this is not A Cancer Book reaction--while valid of course since we need more Not Cancer Books--sort of eclipses the problems with what the book IS Not sucking in this particular way which is indeed sucky isn't the same as telling a story that feels interconnected and authentic I never believed Hazel Her words always felt put in her mouth her actions often constructed her free will seemingly always either Leading To Something or Leading To Pointing Out How It Isn't Leading To Something The book gets a lot of (deserved) credit for being about the people affected by cancer and not about Lessons Learned and Inspirations Found and the romance between Augustus and Hazel was truly about them as whole people not as people defined by and ruled by cancer (while also happily not about pretending the cancer isn't there or treating it like something to See Past; it is necessarily part of them)And I still didn't like themI didn't like the bookIt was sort of like all the pieces of the car were in place and fit the way they should but then you turn the key and the engine doesn't turn over and no one knows why It didn't go anywhere for me There were pockets of truth and touching revelations but they weren't attached to people for me I almost always care about characters I cry over books even when they're not particularly sad It takes an odd amount of awkward distance between the character and their words to make me disconnect enough not to cry over them I went into the book expecting to cry and I didn't It was weirdI sure hope there aren't any kids out there who bought cigarettes and walked around purposely not lighting them for a metaphor
Let me begin by saying that I am no longer the target audience for this book That was very apparent to me by the end of the first chapter By the time I was at 34% my Kindle said I had two hours left so I stuck with it I felt I owed it to &lt;s&gt;Romeo and Juliet&lt;/s&gt; Gus and Hazel to finish this tragic love story I should also say that I knew the ending before I started reading The book has been a bestseller for two years If you don't know the ending you might be living under a rockAnyway I finished the book and I'm glad I did The ending almost redeemed the book That is why I gave it 2 stars instead of 1 I say almost because I can look past the teenage angst I feel forced to look past the cancer because I have never had cancer and it would be heartless of me to trivialize the suffering of two fictional teenagers because I don't understand their plight I do feel like Green uses cancer as a contrived plot device to guarantee the emotional entanglement of his readersThe only cancer related complaint I have is when Hazel says that the only thing worse than having cancer is being the parent of a child with cancer (I'm paraphrasing but I can see that I need to start underlining quotes that I want to comment on) Anyway after reading all about Hazel's teenage existential existence she gives us this very mature (for a 16yo) statement It felt like the author was pandering to those readers who might be parents of cancer patients How would Hazel know what is worse As evidenced by the entire rest of the novel teenagers are the center of their own universe Even more so when they have cancer (if this book is to be seen as realistic)On to my more pressing complaintsWhen Hazel first meets Gus he pulls out a cigarette and puts it in his mouth She freaks out because she struggles to breathe She is angry that he would give money for and use a product that creates cancer Gus quickly explains to her that it is a metaphor He puts the cancer causing cigarette in his mouth but doesn't light it so that it doesn't have the power to kill him Magically Hazel is OK with this As long as he doesn't light it and only supports the cigarette industry buy purchasing them and giving them free advertising everything is just peachy Seriously Really This blazing hypocrisy is our first introduction to Gus and HazelAnother complaint is something that may be completely plausible but it doesn't seem so to me If Gus was in remission for 18 months how is it that he didn't know his cancer had returned until it was too late Did he skip his scans and blood work for those 18 months One day he just decided to have a PET scan and all of a sudden he lit up like a Christmas tree With no warning Seriously I know Osteosarcoma is a form of cancer created for the book and that there is now way to know how quickly is spreads But if the original warning signs and subsequent diagnosis were due to a small highly treatable tumor doesn't it seem more likely that Gus would have had plenty of warning that the cancer had returned Does that mean he knew the whole time he was friends with Hazel and just lied to her the whole time Hazal wasn't kidding about his hamartiaAnd can we talk about the sex please How does a kid with full blown Osteosarcoma walk around Amsterdam climb all the stairs in the Anne Frank museum help his sick girlfriend through the aforementioned museum and then return to the hotel and have the energy to have sex Maybe sex is different when your are dying from cancer It's one of those things I can't comment on without sounding heartless But he could barely walk the next day Gus had already started chemo so where did this burst of energy come from And while this sex scene was relatively chaste why did it have to be included Why do these dying teens have to have sex to prove their relationship They don't They're relationship could have been just as sweet and poignant without the sex (If you can't tell I'm not a fan of sex in YA fiction)But while we are talking about Gus and Hazel's sex scenewouldn't she have noticed the fresh scar from his recently removed PICC or Central line when they were lying there naked Gus told Hazel that he had started his chemo before he left for Amsterdam and stopped to go on the trip The first time Hazel sees Gus after returning from Amsterdam she notes that Gus has already has his PICC line put in These events make it most likely that he had his IV removed before Amsterdam So there would have been a fresh scar And they were naked Maybe it was a magical IV that left no traceWith all those complaints out of the way I will say that &lt;spoiler&gt;Gus' sickness and death&lt;/spoiler&gt; redeemed the book for me The book seemed more realistic once they returned from Amsterdam The emotions felt more authentic Hazel obviously developed and grew as a person She cared about what would happen to her parents after she died and she finally became aware of why Van Houten was the was he wasIt makes me wonder if any of the complaints I have are shared by any teenage readers The second part of the book (after Amsterdam) was by far better than the first Unfortunately the first part was so annoying to me that the second part didn't entirely make up for it Hazel and Gus somehow manage to turn cancer into a farce It definitely didn't help me to understand the tragedy of living with cancer or even having a loved one with cancer The ending is not cancer specific Most people in the world know the pain of &lt;spoiler&gt;losing a loved one&lt;/spoiler&gt;I do just need to end with saying that I don't hate people with cancer I swear I don't I don't even hate tragic love stories What I do hate is when authors use fake versions of real diseases as a method to garner sympathy for their ridiculous characters and their magical love-at-first-sight tragedies

I dislike having the same type cancer as the leading lady who is on her way out  that made things a little more uncomfortable for me but Some good discussion and interesting plot  Well worth reading
One of if not my top favorite books written by John Green This book will make you laugh it will definitely make you cry and it will show you that love can come on quick and leave you reeling Amazing
Hazel and Augustus abd their story of their star-crossed love will warm your heart as you cry your eyes out It is an amazing book but not for people who can't take sad books I still recommend it though
i love this book so very much i suggest this book to anyone it is such a beutiful story and will have you turning the pages as fast as possible John Green is one of my all time favorite authors DFTBA
A very tender and moving story of love and devotion of teens facing the inevitaility of death written in a softly touching (oppsite to heart-breaking) language A contemporary sonnet a rapsody in blue
I don't believe I can even begin to sum up how incredible this book is I feel I truly know Hazel and Augustus I cried at least once every ten pages and laughed at least every five Worth every penny
This is by far the best book I've read in a long time  I could not put it down  It was the perfect combination of sad and funny  Congratulations to the author for such an amazing piece of literature

I am a book worm and im always looking for a good read This book was an amazing story Sad story line but amazing nonetheless Cute love story that will have you read it through in one sitting (i did)
John Green did an amazing job with this book I laughed cried and wished for more I fell in love with the characters and the book was masterfully written  I highly recommend this novel to anyone
this is one of the books that makes you think about what your life means to you Please ignore the brian dead jerks that say it has hard words they have below average iq points this book is amazing
Everyone loved this book but to me it wasn't that good I expected the death to be morethe funeral to have more emotion but no This book was so boring and I was expecting more SORRY but I hated it
I've never felt so many emotions while reading a book This book is funny uplifting heart renching and so much more I recommend this title to anyone over the age of 14 Best book I've EVER read
This book is amazing John Green has absolutely outdone himself He has once again created characters that are so realistic you'll have the urge to reach inside the book and hug them AMAZING book
Like the best book everthere is some foul language and some PG-15 stuff in there but it is so romantic and sweet Sometimes it's hard to think that somewhere this is a true story
This book was amazingly beautiful and sad If you only read one book this year it must be this one It moved me deeply In fact I have not been so moved by a book ever since Dumbledore died in HP6
An absolutely wonderful book which went to my heart immediatelyIt is a big story about life love and death with young and very wise personsThis book will shine forever in your memory

This was probably the best book I have ever read I just couldn't put it down I loved Augustus so much and I cried so hard I couldn't help it And you are right John Green every word was right
I loved this book The characters felt authentic albeit a bit smarter and wittier than the average teenager I passed it on to my 12 year old daughter and she loved it too I highly recommend it
It caused many emotions in my chest I laughed cried gasped I never wanted it to end This book reminded me of how blessed my life is and how lucky I am to be healthy and smartI loved it

Being a lazy teen I don't normally read for the fun of it I liked the book a lot and its not long at all and easy to read Although I didn't cry (because I'm heartless lol) it was extremely sad
This is a heartfelt book of two young people struggling with something much larger than they could ever imagine This book will make you laugh and cry Very well written I could not put it down
This book was absolutely amazing and I couldnt put it down I laughed I cried but more importantly i fell in love with the main characters great read for teens and adults Absolutely loved it
this book captivated me from the beginning it has everything i look for in a book and i couldnt put it down i would reccomend it to anyone who wants a good cry and a book that sticks with you
definiteley read this book i really liked it a lot it had the perfect amount of humor and tradjety i can assure you that all teens and most adults will enjoy this book (i have read it twice)
John Green tells us a wonderful story of young love through an interesting and unique perspective  Appropriate for all ages this young adult novel gets an A rating from this 30-something guy
Amazing read definitely in my top 5 books This is a charming funny touching story I think everyone would enjoy this book it kept me laughing all the way through and then crying at the end
I could not put this book down Such a beautifully written story made even better by the signature on the first page This book goes beyond fiction and merges with real life I loved it DFTBA
I first want to say that I am a part-time educator I thought this was a very tired predicable story It ends sadas you would expect I would NEVER RECOMMEND IT----EVEN TO MY WORST ENEMY
This is the saddest yet happiest book I have ever read and it has humor and the best hear trenching love story anyone has ever dreamed of üòçüòçüòçüòçüòçüòçüòçüòçüòçüòçüòçüòçüòçüòçüòçüòçüòçüòçüòçüòçüòçüòçüò≠üòòüòç
Sweet tender and touching Lets hope that they do not mess up the movie A very good representation of teenagers lives Throw in love angst and death and you have a modern love story Enjoy
i loved it sooo much but i hated that gus died it killed me ugh but it was amazing anyways i strongly encourage everyone to read this book it teaches you to enjoy the simpler things in life
Although this book did not make me cry it is a beautiful story and surprisingly I found myself laughing quite a lot Books rarely ever make me laugh out loudLove everything about it
truly a great tale of start crossed lovers although the book had cancer in it it wasn't about cancer it was about hope and cherishing the moments you get in life definitely worth the read
Although I found this one to be more serious than his others this book had me laughing crying and wanting more  I couldn't put it down  It is a must read I feel it made an impact on me
Another great book by John Green  VERY different from his others but a worthwhile read  It's not as sad as you may suspect Green's unique sense of humor is all over The Fault in Our Stars

The Fault in Our Stars is a  very good book I loved it I cried when Hazel cried over Augustus' s death Oops spoiler alert I felt really happy when she read his letter it warmed my heart
The story and characters are well crafted and written for beautifully The book's honesty is something I appreciate and of course I'm not saying it's honest for everyone it's honest for me
The characters were so well-drawn the voices of Hazel and Augustus (and their parents) so true  I'll never forget this book  I don't read many books twice but I will read this one again
Amazing book really is a must read so thought provoking soul searching and emotionalI cried like a baby and was emotionally spent but glad I plucked up the courage to read it finally
My 15 yr old daughter loved this book It was a beautifully written thought provoking book The characters were so intelligent witty and irresistible to love You may need a box of tissue
I fell in love with Hazel and Gus my heart ached for these kids and wanted to read more and more about their love Read it but don't start late at night You won't be able to put it down
It's the most depressing book ever I knew the plot before I began reading it yet I had hoped that somewhere it would rise above the hopelessness Instead it continually kept me in tears
I haven't read it yet but I received my signed copy in the mail yesterday Can I just take a moment to say the John Green is the most asdfghklt author ever 150000 signed copies DFTBA
This is such a wonderful book John Green takes the lives of two teenagers and weaves the most beautiful funny poignant touching and tragic story I have ever read Read well and DFTBA
This book is an incredible heart wrenching tear jerking humors  I've realized they a movie out this majesty I hope they captured it well To anyone on the fence about reading please do

Good book  Easy read Worth the time
A-M-A-Z-I-N-G I cried like a baby lol
Easy read sad story Good beach read
Sad and seemed like a real life story
One of the best books I have ever read
It is a beautiful story  tear jerker
Fast interesting read Very sad also
This was a good read  I figured out the 'plot twist' way before it was revealed  I can see how this will make an effective movie  Not my favorite book ever but not terrible either
Funny entertaining and sad in a glorious way Raw and forces you to toil with your own mortality while making you feel infinitely grateful for life and its resplendant imperfections
This is an amazing story the subject matter of which is incredibly sad but the book never feels maudlin  Trying to get my teens to see past the subject and read this wonderful book
I'm 32 and I loved this book Moving intelligent funny Definitely John Green's best book I recommend this to anyone looking for a good plot intellectual stimulation and romance
This book was amazing but I can't believe what happened I thought that Hazel would be the one to pass away but no they had to make Augustus die I literally cried and it made me sad
It was excellent reading  These kids are really real about death and limited life to the point of being able to laugh and see humor in the tragedies they go through  Great spirit
TFIOS was one of the best books I have read in a long time It made me laugh cry and it even made me angry sometimes I'd recommend this book for anyone because it's truly amazing
It was a touching book that makes you laugh and cry The characters feel real It's a quick read perfect for my spring break Am definitely going to be looking at Green more often
What an emotional story Cancer can be a tricky thing to write about but Green did a great job I cried but I also found levity in parts I would say the best YA novel of the year
This is one of those books that I couldn't put down It is full of laughter and tears and love and pain A wonderful story from a wonderful author Read it you will love it DFTBA
I read all of the reviews and because they were so high I thought I would try it  Interesting plot and well written but it just didn't keep my attention like I thought it would
I love this one  its supost to be serious but its really funny and also like a great book hidden behind this little story you'll find the deepest truth about love life and death
Was a good read Enjoyed it very much
Decent &amp; fast read  would recommend
Wonderful book Couldn't put it down
So many hidden meanings in this book
Great book read it in two days Haha

Awesome book great download as always
Very easy read and kept my attention
This definitely a book for teenagers
Brilliant and beautiful storytelling
this book was great Sad but great :)
Read the book and saw the movieGreat
A great novel to read because it is real in detailing the struggles that can come with having cancer On top of that it covers ideas that can be thought provoking and inquisitive
Read this book  It is so beautifully written and will make you laugh cry and want to read it again  I was a little hesitant to read it at first but so glad I did
Loved it  Character development was great-- beautiful ending  I highly recommend  Laughed and cried-- very moving  One of those that causes you to think about life in general
I love how he writes but that's just a personal thingThe novel is hilarious and thought-provokingYes it is a keeper in my opinionThank you Mr John Green
Excellent written the book made my cry and laugh and once I was finished  I had a great feeling because it shows you how love can be found at any age and in any circumstances
A friend recommended I read this and I am very glad I did Finished the whole thing in two days with about a whole box of Kleenex It's a sad book but definitely worth reading
Explains the lives of two innocent children in the cruel world  Left me crying half way through it Love this book and recommend it to readers everywhere üíõüíôüíúüíö‚ù§Ô∏èüíóüíìüíïüíñüíûüíò
I read all 336 pages on a five hour plane ride across the country I hung on to every single word and couldn't put it down Best book I've read all year I highly recommend it
Best book I've read in some time It is touching and well written with unique characters Yes the subject matter is sad but the story is more common than most want to believe
This is a heartbreaker but the writing was solid and the characters were so well crafted  I could picture them and who they were and feel each of their individual sufferings
I've enjoyed several of Green's books but he has outdone himself with this one It goes beyond the expectation of the young adult genre and is simply a great book about life
Excellent book Discussed emotionally difficult subjects very eloquently  The characters had depth and complexity I'm adult and would recommend this to both adults and teens
A instant classic I will be reading this book over and over Giving life meaning and being able to look at our faulty stars and still see the great love and hope for humanity
i may not be some big book critic but if you see a problem with this book then you must be reading something different i am rarely moved by booksbut this one stole my heart
one of the most touching and endearing books i have read in a long time ihave passed it on to many of my friendsthey also have been touched by this sadbut wonderful story
I cried through this whole book So moving loved the characters quiet literally one of the most amazing YA books out there John Green is amazing His books never disappoint
This is the ultimate pop culture cancer book and everyone loves it so of course it came highly recommendedHere's what I loved about it:*The language John Green writes a mean descriptive passage and he does capture much of the essence of the cancer experience in this book He also neatly weaved star metaphors and references throughout the pages*The references to philosophers This is one of the smartest young adult novels that I've seen on the market*Hazel is not as insipid as BellaHere's what I didn't love about it:*The protagonist is a caricature and so are the rest of the characters None of them felt real to me*The ending- and not for the reason you'd think I was highly disappointed that over and over again the author referred to the ending of another book and then chose not to write the ending that way I was strongly hoping he continued those references into something meaningful He didn'tHaving multiple people in my life that have died of cancer meant that I teared up once during my reading of this book; however it was no thanks to the characters The best bits of the book are the soliloquizing and being a fan of Tom Robbins I can certainly appreciate that This book would have had more depth without the plot as a simpler writing on the emotions and thoughts involved with cancer - however without the love story the masses wouldn't have bought it Well played Mr Green
I am middle aged man perhaps not target audience for this book but it is one of best books I have ever read The characters will live in your heart for a long time Magical
A very good book and a moving story
Poignant and funny at the same time
so though provoking and well written

So amazing and couldn't put it down
Good book You will need tissues
Very predictabile Quick easy read
Wonderful book about human relations
I'm 19 years old and have fallen in love with a book How does this happen I strongly recommend this intriguing book to anyone looking for a great read and a few good tears
This is an absolutely beautiful story that will pull you in from the very beginning Although we have a vague idea of what will happen I honestly didn't expect the ending
I can't wait to see what they do with the movie  I am honored to have met these characters  I couldn't imagine living through what so many cancer patients have to endure
I have never been so moved by a book before I started rereading it as soon as I finished because I already missed the characters It's just as good the second time around
I absolutely loved this book and think back to it often The characters were beautifully written and the story is uplifting despite the sad content It's a wonderful book
If you enjoyed Looking for Alaska this is another great book from John Green It's set between two adolescent teenagers who mature as the book gets moving along
It made me laugh it made me cry It was the only realistic work of fiction about teenagers with cancer that presented them as multidimensional intriguing and compelling
The contemplation about life and death from weakly formed characters and like teen-speak was yawn-inducing  Recommended for those who've only lost a grandparent or two
Wonderfully touching book- an easy and enjoyable book While its ending and plot line mirror many YA novels greens characters and writing style never grow old or tiresome
The book is very well written and you end up really caring for the characters It has a lot of lyrical prose and makes you think about your own mortality Excellent read
This book is perfect John Green can really portray the teenage mind without over doing it The plot is great and the writing is fantastic John Green is a genious :) xx
I loved it John Green has once again produced a fantastic book that sends your emotions into total warfare I smiled I cried I laughed and I loved it Read it Now
The teen characters are far more witty and saucy than any teens I have ever met but the story is a poignant and honest journey into the darkness of life death and God
A must read Couldn't put this one down Would love to know if he is going to write a sequel to this one because the reader is left hanging - but still an amazing book
This isn't a cancer story but a love story and a beautiful one at that  I loved the characters as well as both the figurative and literal journey they went on together
Not for me - another cancer book
I loved it  Made me laugh and cry
One of the best books ever written

Great book  Better than the movie
Beautiful and inspiring Loved it
This is by far one of the best books I have ever read I hate the ending as well as hazel did in an imperial of affliction I really want to know what happens to hazel
This book was recommended to me by a friend and wow I'm so happy I listened John Green has written a touching story that I'm sure to recommend to my other friends too
Sorry read because of the hype and a New Yorker article about the author - whom I found an interesting man This book is just plain boring Green took a short story and dragged it out to novel length Not one bit of real teenager language Green having sanitized it so as not to offend all the sensitive ears in his target audience I cared very little for Hazel simply because you only get a sophomoric glimpse into her character Don't bother
This is by far the  best book I have ever read I recommend this book to anyone who wants  a good read Five million stars but five is the highest rating I could give
This is by far one of the most overrated formulaic and pretentious books I've ever read not to mention morbid and really depressing even if it is about cancer patients; the cancer itself is nothing more than a plot crisis in this book which is why the character Gus goes terminal when a surprising crisis is needed for our entertainment It's all so witty cute and convenientit's cookie cutter cancer meets the doomed boy relationship from Titanic
This book is one of the best books I have ever read the connection that Augustus and Hazel is just superb  This book is romantic and a book I would love read again
This is now my favorite book I fell in love with Hazel Grace and Augustus I could read this book over and over again and never get tired of it By far a great book
My sons and I enjoyed this book so much My 8th grader wrote about it for his summer reading book report and was so inspired he exceeded the page limit A great book
You'll laugh you'll cry and you won't stop reading until you reach the end Beautiful written story with characters who swiftly dig in to your mind and your heart
I really liked this book As a person who has spent more than my fair share of time in hospitals I found it very relatable and true The story was honest and great
The story draws you in makes you feel the characters are real and then your head spins when it ends It was a surprise read and is now on my list of Favorite Books
Excellent book in great condition
So awesome better than the movie
One of my all time favorite books
I like a story that makes me care
Great book  Tear jerker for sure

I loved this book I recommend it to anyone who likes a quick fun read The book was amazing okay Okay The characters were hysterical and easy to follow Okay
This was a quick but very memorable book  Pages 259 and 260 contain one of the most poignant wonderfully thought out passages that I have read in quite a while
Love the characters and their quirky original relationship Just enough detail without dragging anything out unnecessarily Great read can't wait for the movie
Quick and engaging read An honest story Very we'll written and hard to put down Recommended to me by a friend and I will definitely pass it on to someone else
John for all you do all you've done and for the amazing community you've brought together through your unpretentious insights and inspiring honesty thank you
this book was captivating brought you in from the very beginning and had some great quotes and insights  the characters were believable and felt very real to me
Literally cried for the entire last hour of my reading It's a -you can't put down because you're enthralled  in your reading book enjoyed from beginning to end
Love this bookThis was the first book that ever made me cryToo goodAll starsI didn't want this to end but all good things come to an end
I adored this book Brutally honest uplifting and yet so sad This love story isn't so conventional and that's probably what I really liked the most about it

The story is grim subject matter but the characters are funny lovable and their relationship is as deep and real as anything  I was sad to see the story end
I really enjoyed this book  It even surprised me a bit at the end Great character development - I really cared about the characters and what happened to them
I have not read this book but I am excited to finally do so because I have heard great things about it It shipped very quickly and in great condition Thanks
Totally enjoyed this book The characters are real and brave What a testimony to the resilience of youth and to once again realize that life is just not fair
Story was interesting characters were realistic and (although many will disagree) I felt like they had depthWill probably read another John Green Book
This is one of the best books ive ever read  it is quite a teer jerker i fell in love with hazel and augustus from the start it gave me a new outlook on life
Without a doubt one of the best young adult books I have ever read It is flawless So I'm not really sure why you wouldn't want to buy The Fault In Our Stars
This book is shallow arrogant poorly written and unbelievable just like all the 5 star 2 line reviews that were posted on May 7  This book has been placed in my children's middle school library and I will be filing a formal complaint to have it removed  It is not only the subject matter that is inappropriate but it isn't even well writtenThe 16 year old character is unbelievable  He has made her sound like a sarcastic boy rather than a girl  He has the conversations with her parents written out like a script It's awkward to read as an adult and then I become repulsed as a parent to think that my 13 year old daughter read this because it was in the school libraryDid I say that I will be filing a formal complaint with the school board to have this book removedI have had two friends die of cancer and I know from talking with them about their diagnosis and their treatments that they would never refer to other cancer patients or survivors as bastards  And this isn't the tone or thinking that I would want my daughter to emulate  If people think this is a form of sarcastic humor and is a true look into the questions of a teenager about life and death then this is a big part of the problem with our societyIf you are a parent of a 12-14 year oldtake my word and know that this is not a book for them to read  Sex between a 16-17 year old is not something I want my children to read nor the language and sarcastic rude references about other people  Public displays of affection causing the anger of the surrounding adults is not something to be proud ofThere isn't a plot there isn't a deep story it's rushed and shallow  Save your money and your time
I bought this book solely on the fact that it had gotten 15000 five star reviews You would think that many 5 star reviews it must be great I was sadly wrong It had so many made up words in it it was difficult to read The story was also very poorly written In 321 pages I really could not even tell you what it was about It's sad they are making a movie about it Save yourself the time and money and just skip this read
Wonderful Highly recommend A+++
Good book believable characters
My granddaughter loved this book

best and saddest book i ever read
Sad but a great story Easy read
Avery goodsad book  A good read
Great book  I really enjoyed it
This is a young adult book and I am far from that but loved the book  Great characters and story  I think every young person should read it but also adults
The premise of this sounded too dark but the love and humanity that suffused every moment of pain left me grateful for having met these beautiful characters
I didn't like the fault in our stars one bit  There was no excitement even when Gus died  The language was awful and some of the topics were inappropriate
Cannot say enough about this book - it made me laugh then made me cry  Wonderful characters and a couple twists I wasn't expecting  This was a great book
I absolutely loved this book It was very good and very very sad I think I cried nonstop through the last third of the book but it was absolutely worth it
I enjoyed this book because it had a way of really bringing the reader into the story It made me feel like I was living the story along with Hazel and Gus
This was easily one of the best books I've read It was really sad but so powerful It made me feel every emotion I would recommend this to anyone really
This book made me cry and laugh like never before As soon as I finished it I felt an immense sense of disappointment because I wanted it to go on forever
I loved the book it was well written and very inspiring after that book i started to apreshiate my life moreI enjoyed this book hope you will too
The story was okay but with all the hype about it I expected SO much more  This book just was not a page turner for me  Maybe the movie will be better
Once I started it I couldn't put it down  It made me laugh and cry I felt like I was really there living right along with the characters Great writing
It might have been stated but I did not see that it was hardcover I thought it was paperback Also it was delivered in 10 days much to my surprise (:
My son was assigned to read this book over the summer Surprise He loved it He couldn't put the book down And this was a school assignment Enough said
This was a great book The plot characters pacing dialogue emotion- everything- was so well done I highly recommend this to teens and adults alike
Great book  Recommended to all
What wasn't to love about it :)

This book lede through an emotional roller coaster I loved it from the first page to the last I would definitely recommend it to everyone and anyone
I knew right from the beginning I would love this book John Green has done it agin I love the story I love the writing and i love the characters
**spoiler alert**When you watch a special about John F Kennedy or Abraham Lincoln you know it's going to end badly And so goes a book about a young girl with terminal cancer that falls in with a young boy she meets in a support group that is also recovering from cancerI am not really into reading books that I know are going to be sad and I really only read this because my book club was reading it In fact I am a little surprised that this has been at the top of the New York Times best seller list for young adults for so longThe entire time I was reading this book I was just waiting for the characters to die and as the main character Hazel fell in love I found myself wishing both her and her boyfriend would survive and live happily ever after knowing all along one or both of them is probably going to die soon That being said there is still some uplifting and beautiful dialog between the characters which would be suitable for someone looking for content to write a eulogy-which is the only reason I did not rate this less than the generous 3 stars I gave itI would not recomend this book unless you are the type of person that enjoys Chicken Soup for the Soul style stories and you are looking for a good cry
I was intrigued with the review on NPR so I picked this for our book club My teenage daughter decided to read it as well Very moving and thoughtful

Wow what a great book I really got Into the characters and felt like I was in the story Everyone buy this book I absolutely loved it
the short version: wow John Green's writing is amazing and beyond any other young adult book I've read the longer video review here: []
Great book heartwarming love story about two young teenagers with cancer Recommend this I couldnt put it down and finished it in 24 hours
This book is perfection To say anything more would be reductive This is the best book John Green has written and I fear will ever write
This book in my opinion was unfinished  The ending could gave been so much betterwith Hazel becoming pregnant and dying giving birth
The Fault in Our Stars was Eloquently written characters you care about and a quick readCancer is a killer plain and simple
I just didn't love it Story was trite and predictable I was disappointed as it came highly recommended to me  Just another teen romance
Author John Green lost his faith while attending seminary and working in a children's cancer ward It is understandable that he would need to struggle with this loss in writing It is unconscionable that he is doing it in teen fiction Our teens need hope Sometimes it's a matter of life and deathOf course I am being too harsh It's a good story and well-written It is full of compassion and struggle with important questions If this were one book among many hopeful uplifting teen books I wouldn't object But it's notThis view of life is too small John Green The quote is wrong Shakespeare said: The fault dear Brutus is not in our stars but in ourselvesI have been with dying people and with children who are at peace with suffering and with God This is a realityIt is also a reality that it is very difficult to forgive God when you're on a children's cancer ward That's okay I feel helpless and angry when children suffer too But I yell at God not at the children And I don't make fun of others who are sincerely trying to help even if they do it badly Hope can heal Despair can kill As writers the fault dear John is in ourselves

Fast reading Just for teens
You don't get a say in getting hurt in this world but you do get a say in who hurts youA whole new perspective on life
Never do I want to read of young people dying but this book takes a realistic view  This isn't so much about dying as its a love story
Love is wanting to tolerate the pain it causesEleven more words requiredSeven more words requiredThree more words
This book was delivered promptly and in excellent conditionThe Fault in Our Stars is a very good readGood job Mr Green
dis book was da bomb digaty you should totally read this book because hazel finds the author and gets in love with gus she doesent die
this story is beautiful and brutally honest Augustus will get his wish and haunt me during my most quiet moments well done mr greene
I laughed I cried I loved this book I just wish the ending would have been different but I guess thats what the author was going for
This is an excellent read with honest and raw feelings laid on the line It is a must read particularly for teenagers and young adults
The characters were authentic The story grabbed a hold of my heart and never let go Wonderful book you won't be able to put it down
Very cathartic book it made me laugh and cry couldn't put it down very deep book covering the realities unfairness and beauty of life
Just an amazing read with every emotion Loved every character too Several surprises and didn't see a few coming Excellent insights
Wonderful book Can't wait for the movie Reviews  about the casting and directing make it even more exciting to anticipate the movie
This was a beautifully written story  The characters are so real and natural but most of all worldly and insightful for their ages
This is the type of novel that makes you feel as if you were born lived and died in a whole other world brought alive by the author
A great read Definitely Greens best His characters always pull me in and I fall in love so funny sarcastic easy it's a great story
Best book i have read  thus far It impacted me in ways beyond belief I now look at the world differently due to our desr john green
Best Book I've read this year  The characters memorable  The dialogue true A small book with a big heart and a bigger philosophy
My daughters love this book

Awesome book I recommend it
Amazing writer amazing book
I absolutely loved this book
It was very good a expected
It was boring &amp; predictable
Movie and book closely match
Well written engaging story
This is just amazing He did the unthinkable Killing off a main character But that's what made this book so much more interesting
This book is amazing and really tugs at the heart This is DEFINITELY a must read (May need a box of tissues afterwards though) :'(
You will cry your eyes out because this story is so great Great book and great author Will definitely be buying more of his books
Its a great story that is funny at times sad at times but it definitely makes you reflect on life and those who are terminally ill
This book will make you never want to put it down You will cry and get your heart ripped out many times but this book is worth it
This is by fair the best book I ever read it really makes you think about life in a different light I would recommend it to anyone
The book was amazing it was all I like romantic but I could never put it down The book was sad very sad but it had a happy ending
A very well written book Finally an author who makes us think about our lives What are our values What do we think is important
This is a fascinating story which kept me intrigued all the way through  Great perspective on living life with a terminal illness
Wonderful  It was such a great story and well written  I was there with them thru the entire book  Will recommend to every one
Amazing book So glad I bought it instead of waiting for the library's ebook to be ready I'll definitely read it again &amp; again
Book has a good story but is extremely slow moving which makes it difficult  I enjoy a book that I have a hard time putting down
This book has to be read Incredible powerful astonishing fantastic All of the right adjectives describe it You must read it
What an excellent book:  funny and sad at the same time with clever dialog and well-drawn characters  Best I've read in a while
** spoiler alert **I was very eager to read this book It really took me into a world that I knew nothing about At times I thought maybe I was going to give it 4stars but it just never grabbed a hold of me as I hoped I enjoyed all the times when the author talked about Augustus and Hazel I like how their relationship developed I liked how two young kids in a crappy situation found each other I enjoyed their time in Amsterdam and their first kiss Who gets to say they had their first kiss at Anne Franks place And then it went further and they had sex But it just all lacked for me I guess I wanted Hazel to talk more about her feelings for him She just shared a first kiss with the guy and had sex His first time not sure about for her I don't remember it saying And not that I wanted juicy details of that night just a little more substance with these 2 kidsI read the below sentence on someone else's review and I would have to agreeBut ultimately what pissed me off was the fact that the book gets so deep and at the same time says absolutely nothing
Wonderfully thoughtful Perspective on death living and love is refreshingI can't wait to read more books by this author
One of my favorites of John Green This book will make you cry your eyes out but changes you in an amazing way MUST READ
Much an amazing memorizing book really changes the way you think about life and the way you look at things just truly amazing
Incredible book  It was beautifully written and easy to read  Completely heart wrenching but amazing  I couldn't put it down
Absolutely amazing John Green Is a fantastic author and I would read anything by him I bought two more of his books yesterday
This book is amazing We all should read I couldn't put it down Sad and beautiful story Want to see how the movie turns out
The book wasn't completely new but it was new looking It came on time; I never regret buying this book I recommend it to all

Yet another wonderfully written book by John Green I recommend this to anyone wanting a good read Would make a perfect gift
This is truly a inspirational and honest book I read it in two days and couldn't put it down It will captivate and move you
WOWWhat a great read  Sad and sweet Makes you realize life is to short  I cannot wait to read the authors other books
Ok I`m not really going to type a huge review Just Just buy it Please do this for yourself This book is beautiful
This book is to awesome John Green really did good in this oneI loved it And i cant wait for the movie to come out
This is one of the best books that I read in 2012  Both heartwarming and heartbreaking without taking itself too seriously
This was a really engaging story The characters were cool interesting It was an easy and really enjoyable read Thumbs up
Extremely good book I could not put it down but it had its sad parts I would recommend it and will probably read it again
John Green has truly written a masterpiece in this book Poetic and witty theres not a dull moment to be found Bravo John
Honestly I thought this was an incredibly cliche novel The plot twist was expected and the dialogue was reminiscent of A Walk to Remember with snobbier literature tastes
This book was so depressing  I was so disappointed because I love John Green's other books  This one just wasn't for me
Remarkably beautiful sad and enlightening all in oneGreat read I am so glad they decided to make the movie
I don't usually write book reviews but this is by far my favorite book You'll laugh you'll cry Definitely a must read :)
The plot and characters in The Fault in Our Stars are great I absolutely loved this book The story behind it is beautiful
This book is exciting and brilliant It's a soon to be classic love story that will warm your heart John Green is amazing
Had my attention from the very start amazing charecters over all it will make your heart happy yet sad all at the same time
When I started I was uncertain but when I got to the plane flight It's my new favorite book Everything is just amazing
This book is great It just is You won't be disappointed Great characters beautiful words &amp; a wonderful story Trust me
Truly exceptional book  I highly recommend reading it; it may well change your life  Infinite pizzas to John Green  Aye
A beautiful and touching story I've never laughed or cried so hard during the course of one single book Simply beautiful

Very interesting book 
Very good movie a must see
Great story well written
Good more for young adults
One of the best books I've read Couldn't put it down very engaging inspirational yet heart breaking at the same time
I must admit I wouldn't have chosen to read this book on my own  A member of the book club I belong to said it had great ratings and might be a good read  This book is about living loving and dying  I'm a grandmother definitely not a teenager yet I learned so much  It emphasized living in the moment because we never know when we are having our last good day  It demonstrated parent/child love as well as the loving relationship between Hazel and Augustus  Lastly I learned about dying with dignity and what I can do to help others in their journey
I love these  coming of age stories This one was really touching and beautiful and is easily one of my favorite books
I pre-ordered a signed copy and loved it this book is amazing i highly recommend it all of John Greens books are great
Great book about the reality of life Excellent writing and very interesting You laugh cry and smile at the same time
This was a fun book  Great first chapter  Intense and easy to read  It is definitly recommended for everyone to read
Tears and more years but to know how someone could love another is just worth the tearslove this story‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏èlove love
I love this book It's really sadI really love it I wish there were romance thoughGreat author Amazing
this book was incredibly inspiring and a lovely novel and is highly recommended This book was also really easy to read
Very deep and philosophical take on life and death I loved the quirkiness and humor John Green uses for his characters
I laughed and cried - excellent insight into the highs and lows of young people with terminal illness  A special book
This book is in parts moving humorous thought provoking and deep An overall superb novel by an equally superb author
Great book but I wish the main characters were not sixteennot really how sixteen year olds actbut still loved it
A beautiful work of literature that conjures long lost emotions An easy fast paced read gratifies the mind and heart
This Is A Wonderful Book I Laughed And Cried And Even Smiled While I Was Crying I Highly Recommend This Masterpiece
This was the best book of all times John Green did a phenomenal job on writing such an inspirational and loving book
Excellent book Touching and absolutely brilliant Jodie sjdid sjdid desks dirks she d did she did she sjdid d didn't
a very heartfelt touching book found myself tearing up at certain parts recommend it to fans of Ellen Hopkins (y)
Will make you laugh and cry your heart out really beautifully written Makes you view death in a very different way

Green has taken my breath away once again with a flawless novel I will never forget Augustus Waters or Hazel Grace
Even though I'm 54 this book made me cry  I couldn't put it down and didn't want it to endExcellent read
Just to be clear: I am 16 I righteously identify as a hypocrite and a pseudo-intellectual myself and I love to read--yet I find myself hesitant to stray away from classics or philosophical works for reasons such as TFIOS This book was promising I'd been recommended it by a considerable number of friends and of course I'd heard the ranting and raving all over tumblr twitter etc I wanted a good cry really and characters I'd grow attached to and really miss by the end of the book I knew someone died (and I assumed it was Hazel) and I knew it was supposed to be sad but my utter distaste for the novel as a whole completely transmuted any iota of empathy/sympathy into what emotion I can only depict as a wrinkled nose and a scoff I've watched John Green's videos and read some of his tumblr posts so I had a pretty good idea regarding his voice [as an author] And though I love to feel an author's voice throughout a novel I heard his ubiquitous and also imposing voice in each and every character I was reading a book narrated by John Green talking to a bunch of John Greens in a very hipster pseudo-intellectual metaphors-on-steroids type universe Not only was his voice intrusively unequivocal but the tone itself bothered me All the characters had these magniloquent flowery gems they frequently thrust upon each other (and the reader) This was wonderfully juxtaposed with the tumblresque emotionspeak of a teenage girl These two tones while realistically juxtaposed just didn't work in a novel setting As I'm typing this grandiloquent review (and mind you I haven't even popped the Thesauruscom tab) I'm also texting lol ya girl omg haha &amp; the likebut if John Green wishes to accurately portray an equally vapid and teenagery and intellectually explorative female character he must be consistent with other accuracies as well I could go on and on about the inconsistencies and inaccuracies present but I'm sure taking a peak at the other reviews will provide insightOne thing I did NOT have a problem with unlike many other reviewers was in fact the flowery language exhibited by each character If consistent it would have flowed beautifully--and thus I think the fundamental flaw in this text was that it depicted teenagers who MUST be balanced as dumb teens and intellectuals in order to speak any truth about them If it was written about adults and thus avoiding any teenagery emotional fluff it would have worked better in my opinion John Green has a good voice His characters are unrealistic flat (I did appreciate Isaac and Lidewij (sp) however) and there was evidence of subtle sexism Examples of this can certainly be found in other reviews as I am much too impatient and indifferent to point them outAll this aside this just wasn't the work for me I felt that it tried WAY too hard to present metaphorical and pretty language that was just inconsistent and awkward The characters were Mary Sue and boring and all projections of the author himself This is the kind of book I like to dub teen fodder; people my age just (sometimes brainlessly) gobble this stuff up There were a few very explicitly and painfully described metaphors and gems that I thought were worthwhile but their blatantness turned me off from appreciating them This is also the kind of book that appeals to pseudo-intellectuals who think that books like this are mind-stimulating andwhatever To say the least I was extremely disappointed and expected at least an interesting plot--if not a literary disappointment--but even that couldn't be offered
Loved it you must read it Weather it's 35 million dollars or free get it and read it You won't be disappointed
Had a slow beginning but th  momentum increased and the live story was  beautiful with the pain of life Good work
This book had me laughing so hard I cried and crying so hard I looked like I was laughing 10/10 Will read again
one of the best books I've read in a long time amazing writingbroke my heart recommend this to everyone 
This is in my opinion the greatest book that I have ever read It is sad romantic and an all around amazing book
John Green has written a masterpiece The Fault In Our Stars is my new favorite novel Definitely worth the read
This book was ok I wasn't overly impressed but most people seem to really like this book I wouldn't suggest it
Tears laughter both in abundance a perfect story that captures young love in all its glory well done Mr Green
One of the best books I've ever readI have never really liked books but now I have a new desire for them
A touching story I could not stop reading  Honest funny and heart wrenching all at the same time A must read
That was one of the most beautiful works of literature I've ever read I laughed I cried and I will never forget
This book is amazing I can only say that it changed my life - I have never cried from reading until I read this
This book made me actually cry and I love that it's always saying some really good detail This book is Amazing
I liked this book  But it made me sad  I would recommend it though good reading  Very easy reading
You can't go wrong with John Green He consistantly puts out stunning works of art And this is his best DFTBA
This is one of my favorite books of all time and I couldn't believe it was signed for so cheap OMG IM SO HAPPY

I could not have picked a more inspiring book Long live the amazing kind hearts of Hazel Grace and Augustus
I'm in love with this beautiful history you have to read it if you like romantic histories and actual times
I cried so hard but it was so worth it because some infinity are larger then others I can't wait for the movie
This book is such an amazing read This book is a tear-jerker and quick read I think everyone should read it
Honestly when this book first came out- it appeared to be pure teenage angst-ridden twaddle with shades of Holden Caulfield and A Seperate Peace thrown in I kept coming back to it; seeing the book EVERYWHERE I am a young married woman in my thirties who is not afraid to read YA fiction Then two days ago I checked this book out from the library And sat down to read it And read it in 24 hours I cried laughed and knodded Hazel and Augustus are such a relatable pair of individuals and I really wanted to know them Obviously someone dies Obviously there are situations which may raise eyebrows or forms of dialogue and speaking- and if you are a person who never has spent time in the presence of cancer survivors or communicated with above intelligent adolescents may not find these characters true or realistic; but I can assure you they are I am reasonably confident this will become a new literary classic written for the modern times
This book is a fast read that makes you believe in true love Definitely worth your time to read Recommended
Great story very touching My book club's first book; great way to start it off It's Wonderful for all ages
I feel like I'm the only one about to give a rating below 4 stars but I must be honest:This was a bipolar read for me The story was gripping but exasperating at the same time I appreciate the sip of raw/original teen characters but I kept wishing for the point of the story to come already Why Because the characters got WAY too I'm unlucky but unforgettably gifted AND irritating with their impressive remarks speeches etcto me there was almost nothing realistic/relating about those teens I didn't even care to understand them; they played their parts annoyinglyI don't want to spoil the book in any way so lastly I will admit that I was a little intimidated at times but what really made me want to run from this book was the moral of the story that seemed to grow like a never-ending mosquito bite Itchy as hell tooVerdict: give it a try
Great book Sad in places but gives you a whole new perspective on life and dying finished it in just a day
John Green is just amazing in my eyes He knows how to be funny in sad moments and bring you back to Earth when you think the world is a fairy tale He does a great job of mixing in relevant pop culture or language that makes you feel as if you could be one of the characters or know one of them This all helps him to force you to read his books with the eagerness of Christmas morning I cannot get enough of John GreenAlso be sure to check out his Webisodes on youtube well worth it
This book is possibly the greatest book ever I recommend everyone to read it It is very sad But so good
A seriously awesome read Loved everything about it so much so I could read it over and over again &lt;3

Great book Easy to read and the story pulls you in to the booki will read this book again  Great author
This book is amazing hands down his best book so far I cried and laughed while reading this book GREAT
This book was so great I just couldn't put it down  I enjoyed how you felt like you new the characters
I recommend this book to any teen Absolutely loved it I couldn't put it down always had me on the edge
Sad life ruiner don't read this if you don't want to cry Stop now and don't purchase this You will cry
Great story my 14 tear old daughter was so intrigued she finished in one day One should read this asap
This book was fantastic I look forward to the movie and I have recommended it to my friends and family
You never know when the end is near so read this book before you die You will never be the same again
You laugh you cry It's hard to find the words to describe this book I think you just need to read it
This is not your typical love and cancer story it is so much better I recommend this book for any age
The Fault in Our Stars is one of the best books I've read all year I recommend it to anyone
As noted this is an amazing bookThis Spring I read it with a group of high school students designated as Long-Term English Learners ‚Äî students who have been in our district for five or more years but are still struggling to pass their English classes and the California High School Exit Examination We read the book together out loud nearly every chapter and every day these students were engaged in what they were reading  Kids were volunteering to read out loud who had previously politely refused to do so; the vocabulary stuck with them and more importantly they understood these characters like they were friends  I have never had a response so strong with any book I have read with of my English classes; I highly recommend this book for all the reluctant readers out there and anyone who wants to understand the experience of cancer from a young person's perspective
Amazing book Couldn't put it down Made me cry at the end I would read this again Love this book
If everyone could read this book there would be no hate on the world  I just can't handle this book
loved it and movie too

Great book sad story
Could not put it down
Incredibly good  book
Was just disappointed
amazingly loved it sad tho :( I wish the ending didn't end like that but it still was an amazing :)))
This novel touched me deeply While I've not lost anyone particularly close to me from the dreaded cancer I feel as though I have witnessed something very real in reading this account of the three teens who live and die because of it  Their relationships with each other are beautifully described I haven't had a good cry like this in a long time  I only wished that they had found the living God in their time of suffering  I kept wanting to pray for them
I loved this book It was  the first john green book I've read but it certainly won't be the last :)
AMAZING You will cry your eyes out I am 30 and I loved this book so much A must read
I can't deal I've never had a book move me this much before I'm so sad Why I feel like crying
Could not put the book down  Finished it in days  All in all a very good read  Enjoyed very much
this book is one of the best things I've read Be ready to cry like a baby and laugh your butt off
If there was such thing as a ten star rating that is what the book would be amazing and wonderful
I love the fault in our stars Although it made me sad it was filled with well thought out scenes
Love love love I think this is a great book for teens and adults It is full of great quotes also
Great story and very well told Loved it I would love for it to indicate what happened to Hazel 
I couldn't put it down even thru my tears So glad I met Hazel and Gus  A wonderful read  Enjoy
This book was so good It made me laugh and made me cry John Green is one of my favorite authors
A beautifully written novel on how first love isn't so innocent The protagonists are a teenage couple in love who both have cancer Their views on falling ill and struggling with their identities as cancer kids is raw and refreshing From Hazel's view it's not about being inspirational or upbeat--it's about keeping it real; from Gus's view it's about infusing humor and loving honestly into daily interactions with others Either way these kids are mature beyond their years and seem to know more about life than most adults They are highly evolved in the way they speak and interact; Green does an expert job of characterization because their maturity is in character Overall I'm happy to see straight YA (not YA fantasy) make a comeback Green should be proud for this accomplishment alone as well as a well-written YA masterpiece
I love all of John Green books except this one It feels weird reading about two kids with cancer dating Their conversation is strange The plot is strange (I read about a third of the book then quit) The main character (the first person) is a girl which has never happened with John Green and she doesn't sound like a girl (All the other girls in Green's books sound like girls)I got the book from the library Lined up for it in July and got it right before Christmas -- there were 500 people lined up ahead of me I didn't even know that there are many readers in my town When I got the book there were 500 people in line behind meI guess I don't really like sick lit I knew this book was about cancer but I wanted to try it anyway because it's John Green Unfortunately for me I couldn't manage to like it
THIS BOOK OH MY GOD THIS BOOK JOHN GREEN YOURE AMAZING YOU LEFT ME WITHOUT WORDS I LOVE YOU OKAY

Tearjerker Loved it
I thought this was one of the best books I've ever read Before I bought it I just assumed it would be just another lame romantic novel- but it was so much more than that It moved me it inspired me I wish i can read it a thousand times I feel like I know the characters Hazel and Augustus so well Althought I don't have terminal cancer- I can relate to them and understand their pain I highly recommend this book Good job John Green
I loved this book and its honesty about life death and love This is a great book for all ages
This is the first book ever to make me cry I truly love this book Read it you'll love it too
i love this book and this author the ending was a huge surprise and its just a great love story
I LOVE IT SO SO SO MUCH AWESOME AND AMAZING There needs to be a sequel I love this book
One of the most boring books I have ever read Couldn't get into at any point It was a letdown
I expected this book to be predictable but it's a great read and journey and  Left me in tears
I wanted to revoke all of my previous 5 star rated books just to prove how special this one is
I haven't yet read all of John Greens but of the ones I have read this is by far my favorite
I gave this book the five star rating because it's one of th only books that can make me cry
Read this book it changed my life and i guarrente it will do the same to yours peace out yeah
This is a good book It is sad and poignant and loving in a way that more books should be
I found this story to be a little flat and it wasn't as romantic as it is made out to be The characters are extremely smart and witty so much so that it's annoying It almost seems like every character has a similar personality which I'm assuming is a personality similar to the author's A great book should have a variety of characters that all somehow fit together not characters that all are exactly the same that coexist I really thought I would connect with this book because I am pediatric oncology nurse but it's very hard to connect when the characters are unrealisticI also did not find this book to be as sad as people say it is I didn't shed a single tear even though I am usually very connected to emotional books I honestly cried harder while reading Charlotte's Web
This book was great
Love love love it

Sad but good u can learn a lot of things from this book I know I did hope y'all like it too
Disappointing I don't understand why this book is so popular I was glad when it ended
So so so goodz broke my heart into pieces and made me happy all at once time I loved it
I like this book but I am only  nine and take about some bad stuff but still a good book
One of the best books you will ever read You need to read this book Go get it now Ah
So like this book was okay or whatever It like felt like I was reading twilight with cancer It like reads like a 16 year olds diary It is like your typical teenage cancer story where like the cancer kid is lucky enough to find love before they die and everything The like frustrating thing about this book or whatever is like this teenager speaks like a stupid valley girl or something and then uses words like: indefatigable monolith nihilism and like uses phrases like the abundant metaphorical resonances of human waste production I felt like the author was trying too hard to make sure we understood these teenager talked like teenagers or whatever Okay I am like exaggerating a little bit or something
Amazing Thank you
My daughter love it

loved this book
A very sweet story
ok but noy the best
I have about another 100 pages to go and it's not anything like I thought it was hyped up to be  I know the young people now read books on vampires and such and play their video games but it seems that they dwell on too much doom and gloom to be healthy--GO OUTSIDE AND ENJOY THE SUNSHINE  These kids are pathetic  I don't want to go into the old story of WHEN I WAS A KID but it's seriously true and getting worse it seems that they are all bloody couch potatoes  I watch cooking shows and because of some healthy problems sometimes I have to do this for hours on end but the amount of STUPID cartoons is ridiculous  Not a bid fan of Seasame Street but at least the kids learned something  HEAVEN HELP THIS GENERATION OF YOUNG ADULTS

Amazing The best
Total tear-jerker
Great quick read
Not up to the hype
i loved this book
What a great read
A real tear jerker
I read this book after all of the hype with the movie  Given that the book is set in my hometown of Indianapolis I was quite excited to read it  Having said that I thought it was just OK  I have to say that I saw the 'twist' very early in the bookI hoped that the author would throw me another curve ball but no such luck  It bothered me that these two kids who were battling cancer had no belief in God or heaven  After knowing kids and families that have also fought the hard fight against childhood cancer I really struggled with that part of the bookI will say that the author is a very good writer  The book just didn't live up to the hype for me  No I did not go see the movie
Knowing children and adolescents have cancer is a horror of truth  Adults wonder at their strength through the process of fighting it and parents are tested beyond limits considered humane Seeing your child loose their hair their strength and possibly never reach their potential never knowing the experiences adults remember of their own lives is just not what our society expects for their children  This book covers much of this It brings forward unpleasant thoughts and emotions we know exist but don't want to have  The saving grace is the way it is all presented in this book The feelings are real emotions pure subject something we fear but a book we won't forget  Read it
The Fault in Our Stars is told through the eyes of Hazel - who was set to die of the Thyroid cancer she was diagnosed with at age twelve until at fourteen a medical miracle managed to shrink the tumours in her lungs Now sixteen and despite being told she could live `for a long time' Hazel subsists tethered to an oxygen tank and shut off from the world  That is until Osteosarcoma survivor Augustus Waters walks into her Support Group and changes her lifeIn true John Green fashion this book is somehow equal parts humour and pain I didn't put it down until I was finished and have now read it twice over cover-to-cover  Having been really charmed by one of his other works An Abundance of Katherines I had quite high expectations for The Fault in our Stars This book has fulfilled those expectations and more John Green should be applauded for his handling of the subject matter - and for managing to write a book about sick kids that wasn't a total bummerI've heard it said that the voices of John Green's characters are too alike and that their personalities blur together However that hasn't been my experience It could well be true and I just haven't read enough of him to become jaded about the personalities he creates But in either case I would still gladly spend a hundred books with characters like Hazel and AugustusWhat I Loved:So John Green's characters have a way of winning me over but the real standout is his writing  It's so stunning and insightful that it makes you read a particular passage over and overFor instanceI fell in love the way you fall asleep: slowly and then all at onceI never thought I would be genuinely laughing out loud at a book about slow death by cancer - but it's so irreverent and unexpected and courageous that you forget what you're supposed to be feeling and just go with it This may be a book about dying young but it is so far from the usual Hallmark-movie style sob story that I can't really compare it to any other book about illness that I've ever readWhat Was Lacking:Nothing - for its genre this book is as close to perfect as it getsQuote:When you go into the ER one of the first things they ask you to do is rate your pain on a scale of one to ten and from there they decide which drugs to use and how quickly to use them I'd been asked this question hundreds of times over the years and I remember once early on when I couldn't get my breath and it felt like my chest was on fire flames licking the inside of my ribs fighting for a way to burn out of my body my parents took me to the ER nurse asked me about the pain and I couldn't even speak so I held up nine fingersLater after they'd given me something the nurse came in and she was kind of stroking my head while she took my blood pressure and said You know how I know you're a fighter You called a ten a nineBut that wasn't quite right I called it a nine because I was saving my tenRead this book promise

Good book Sad
The story plot is heart wrenching That was not my issue with this book I did not appreciate the constant use of foul language and the indifference to staying pure The author seems to associate being terminally ill with a license to be rude lewd and basically do whatever is the whim I would not recommend this book to any one to read
The book didn't really have a plot It was just about how the two main characters' relationship developed (with some afterthought of a plot line about tracking down some author) Maybe that's common for love stories; I'll admit that I'm not a fan of the romance genre but I didn't think this book was in that genreConsidering I'm not big on romance and there was no plot though the book was good I don't mean that sarcastically It was so well written and the characters were so believable (most of them) that it hooked me throughout So kudos to Mr Green If he has a non-romance book that actually has a page-turner of a plot I'd love to read it
I totally liked the book in general and I am hoping that John Green will write a sequel where Gus comes back to life and he writes Hazel a sequel and Hazel actually gets cured of her cancer and Gus gets a leg transplant and he has two legs and is very happy I am Hoping for if Mr Green were to write a sequel I would enjoy it more than other sequals of other books I have read  THANK YOU FOR WRITING THIS BOOK MR GREENPS I am a bit in love with this book I think that I am more curious about what happened at the end of this book than Hazel qas curious at the end of AN IMPERIAL AFFLICTION Pss what happened to hazels family
I was not aware that it is a book written by an adolescent for adolescents
This is a really good book I don't think it's a great book John Green does a wonderful job delving into the world of Kids With Cancer (to use his capitalization and parlance from the book) but at times it feels like the conclusions and narrative arcs are too predictable I wish I had been thrown for more loops But this critique is liking saying a supermodel doesn't have beautiful eyes Guess what Everything else makes up for that The Fault In Our Stars is a beautiful book and one I'm proud to have read How it got to the level of cultural phenomenon though is a little bewildering To that I tip my hat to John Green and say well done sir

Better than life
Before I write what will be a scathing review I will admit to crying at the end There are sweet parts to this book but overall I hated itThe teenagers speak in an overly witty way as if they're trying to compete with each other for depth and intellectual power Their parents (the adults) come across as bland backdropsThe teenagers seem to go out of their way to 'speak in metaphor' For example Augustus 'smokes' unlighted cigarettes - he puts something in his mouth which can kill him but does not give it the power to do so by leaving the cigarette unlitFor example when Hazel and Gus fly on a plane to Amsterdam he puts one of his unlighted cigarettes in his mouth and when the flight attendant asks him to remove said cigarette Hazel interrupts with 'But it's a metaphor' and goes on to explain the metaphor Why is it that Hazel and Gus feel the need to impose their cleverness on everyone The flight attendant does not care one whit whether the cigarette is a metaphorThroughout the book I couldn't stop rolling my eyes at the dialogue Precocious Hazel and Gus may be but their superceding quality is obnoxiousness
Overall I enjoyed this book It contained humor witty characters and a lot of words I didn't know until I read itHoweverThe amount of bad language astonished me The word s*** was probably on each page at least once in some form Can you please use crap instead Or instead of s***tier worse gets the same point across And please stop using the Lord's name in vain to tell me how attractive Augustus is There are other words I will not write here Although the Fault in our Stars was overall a well written book John Green ruined it with hugely unnecessary amounts of bad language

Excellent book
I enjoyed the language that seemed so different than many other books I have read The way the author conveyed what everyone is thinking but no one really wants to say out loud is comical These young teenagers seemed so wise and eloquent in their words but yet at the ends of their lives I disliked the amount of profanity as I am not a curser but realized most teenagers probably wouldn't have an issue with thisi believe this book would be best suited for teenagers or young adults at heart I enjoyed how everything was ended and would look to read another Green book in the future
This is the story of Hazel and her friends Augustus and Isaac All three of them have a different type of cancer and all are dealing with it in different ways It was very thought provoking to see how each of their families was coping with the cancer that had invaded their children as well I definitely spent some time with tears running down my cheeks as the book is charming and touchingI did have to give it one less star than it deserved due to the bad language and teen sex Unfortunately the language was a little coarse at times which was a shame
Terrible I hated the ending could have done without the cussing
I had read one of John Green's books before (Looking for Alaska) and really liked it I saw the 5 star reviews for this book and decided to give it a try What a waste of money spoilers to followI didn't like any of the characters neither Hazel nor Augustus For some reason I just couldn't see them as real people - they were too glib about having cancer I am a healthcare provider and I can tell you that yes people react in different ways to having cancer but these two were insufferable Besides AUGUSTUS ReallyI could have dealt with the predictable storyline but the whole section about the trip to Europe just completely lost me I thought it was soooo cheesy Especially when they meet the author and he's a loser COULDN'T SEE THAT COMING AT ALL No way he turned out to be a creep After Hazel went to all the trouble of wearing her special outfitI really wanted to like this book but I found Hazel irritating and Augustus idiotic The cigarette metaphor was stupid The cancer perks were moronic The only time I actually got interested was when Augustus was dying and his family wouldn't let Hazel visit I felt like that was the only realistic part of this very self-indulgent story
Finished this in 2 days (would've finished it in one if I hadn't had work) I thought I had this one all figured out and I just waited for things to happen the way I anticipated when it threw a waterballoon and stuck its toungue out at me in the most heart-wrenching way It is engaging it is a page turner it's fun Haven't seen the movie but I might have to now - if it is just half as good as the book I will enjoy it I feel kind of empty now that I finished it It left a void in me in that amazing way that only a great book movie or series is able to
U have never gotten so emotional at a book before As I was was reading everything that Gus said and everything he dud for hazel I'm thinking to myself thus is the exact person I want to find to spend forever with and it depends on how long our forever might be I want to find MY Gus and have that same connection and same romance kindle with the one I will spend forever with whoever he is I still have not found him but I am still looking and will never give up till I find him even thought I am only 13 I have started looking and won't stop till I find him
Un libro predecible y un tanto aburrido No comprendo el √©xito que ha tenido No he visto la pel√≠cula pero como siempre pasa que el libro es mejor ni perder√© mi tiempo pues terminar√© dormida vi√©ndola como me pas√≥ leyendo el libro No me gustan los personajes los adolescentes no hablan as√≠ y me molest√≥ esa obsesi√≥n con un libro y por conocer el final tanto que la protagonista actu√≥ como una ni√±ita malcriada (contrarrestando lo especial madura e inteligentemente que la describ√≠an) Definitivamente no es un libro que me gusto ni lo recomendar√≠a

I read a lot of positive reviews about this book and thought A book about kids with cancer I don't think so I figured it would be kind of preachy and cliche and sad But finally a gave in and I am grateful I did This book is truly about the meaning of life and because it's told through the lens of a teenager it loses much of the possible cliches and inherent pretension There are layers of meaning combined with laugh out loud moments It is honestly one of the best books I've ever read
Definitely not my kind of book I decided to read this book because of all the hoopla everyone was ranting about It wasn't a bad book I wouldn't say I wouldn't recommended it to others It's just not may type My favorite line in the whole book was the final sentence I didn't need my tissues handy because I already knew what was going to happen My daughter loved it and told me the ending after I had told her that I didn't think I would read it Curiosity got the best of me and I gave it a shot
I would have been more inclined to give the book more stars if it had clean language  I detest authors putting in trash language when teenagers will be reading the book  It is bad enough when adults have to be bombarded with it  Not everyone speaks this way  Write a book we can enjoy for the story  It was a very heart wrenching story featuring three teens who meet in a support group for cancer victims  It tells of the agony of friends and families who go through it with them
I didn't connect to any of the characters I had a problem with the beginning because a sentence was a paragraph long I did feel bad for what they were all going through I've known people in my life who have battled cancer Some have won others have not It's not easy to watch someone fight that battleI read the book because I wanted to see the movie I also like the cover of the tie in movie coverI'd say read it for yourself and form your own opinion
I don't want them to think it is a depressing book  It is beautifully written with images ideas inspiration that I loved  Although not a long book it took me quite a while to read it because I had to put it down digest and process it before continuing  Although it's a YA book it is very appropriate for all ages because we are all dealing with end of life issues and decisions---we are all dealing with the loss of a loved one  Life is about Death:  dying is about living

Sweet story
I really wanted to like this book because the commercial for the movie looked so endearing and heartfelt However I was unpleasantly surprised with the most poorly written book I think I've ever read I don't understand the craze I just don't Perhaps I'm ignorant and don't understand all the teenage philosophical thought which I admit was entertaining at times but mostly just for lack of a better word pretentious I found that the most disappointing thing about Mr Green's writing is that he neglected to develop his supporting characters as fully as I am used to Perhaps if I had had more insight into their thoughts and feelings I would have feel anguish over the loss of them I'm not a professional critic but I thought I might be able to save someone a little bit of time if they have other books they could read instead If you want a book to dive deep into and just get lost in please don't read this book It's shallow and as we all know diving in shallow areas is dangerous
I wanted to like it I really did but all it did was romanticize cancer I tried to like it but I couldn't look past that I have read other John Green works and this follows his blueprint so it's not outstanding The only thing that kept me going was that the dialogue was a little different than I'm used to seeing in books and there was a slight twist but nothing shocking I found some of the characters (the mother for one) to be incredibly not smart
This was the single worst book I've ever read It was cheesy unoriginal and predictable I wouldn't recommend reading it and I wouldn't recommend watching the movie In fact the only thing worse than this book is the movie This book is the kind of influence that makes teens the senseless incapable human beings that they are I won't even associate myself with people who enjoyed this bookSincerelySomeone who read it when they were a teen
I give it four stars for the witty catty fun humor despite all the poop dying parts I wanted to love this book there are a lot of amazing quotes in it the writing itself is great Basically about two sick and dying people that fall in love you know one of them will die in the end you know it will end terribly you know it will rip your heart to shreds and hand it to you on a platter but you read it anyway we humans are true gluttons for punishment
Extremely surprising ending to the book  My daughter has been bothering me to read this book so I finally decided with movie coming out I would give it a read  I read a significant amount of books and this was very thorough and thought provoking about the importance of living each day to its fullest  My life has been truly blessed so I have not had to experience cancer within my circle; however I do appreciate the struggle especially among the youth
the writing is weird and i dont like this book its really boring and there is no excitement what so ever
This book is very poorly written about a very sad topic It awkwardly inserts sensationalism in order to keep the young readers attention and to appeal to the movie makers  It could have been written in a gentle and sympathetic way without degrading it in the manner that is presented here  My biggest concern is that teachers are putting this kind of material in the hands of students as low as six graders  I am a retired teacher and would not think of using this book in a classroom as an example of good literature  In fact I would be very upset if my children would have been exposed to this material in any grade  Some authors seem to think they need to present R rated material to get that movie contract and high ratings  Do teachers read these kind of books before using them with students  Very disturbing to know my grandchildren are exposed to this filth when there is multitudes of good literature available
This book grabbed my attention from the beginning I knew what was going to happen and I thought I would be prepared for it The story was amazing and I laughed and cried Twists and turns that came I wasn't expecting but a beautiful love story with true world expectations was told beautifully Life's not a fairy tale and not all love story's end happy Loved this book and I would recommend it to anyone for a good quick light read
I read the reviews before I selected this bookBut I did not find it to be a happy book  When you have been touched by cancer in your life the struggle of these young adults made all the memories come back  Also I'm glad I read it on my Kindle because these young adults used words that I have never heard and I had to keep looking them up  I would not recommend this book to anyone who has recently been touched by cancer

This is my book for Kami Aaron Ryan challengeA very moving romantic story about 2 teenagershazeland Augustus in a cancer support grouphazel  has thyroid cancer and is o Oxygen all the timeAugust is has leg cancerThese hang out together All the timeThey get real closeDealing with this cancermakes them growup fasterthan anyone elseThis story made tears come to my eyesSuch a well written bookit will move you
This story is so beautiful and heartbreaking It may be written for young adults but the language and ideas are breathtaking You have to have a heart of stone to not fall in love with Gus and Hazel
Could not get into it at all  This book is better suited to young adults who will probably relate to it  As a grown women who has never had children I honestly could not  identify with the characters  I thoroughly enjoyed the Hunger Games trilogy and the main characters there were teenagers so based on the rave reviews for this novel I thought I would check it out  Mistake  This book was definitely not for me
Cancer terminal illness and death are not novel and the fact that this book and film have a Twilight-esque following is disturbing; commercializing this brand of pain is bull s*** A biography using the real girl's story and a non-fictionalized version of her story is completely valid but to NOVELIZE (ie: to literally make dying of cancer/losing true love to chance novel) is so gross and weird and creepy I don't mean to insult anyone who may like this book/film but please just take a moment to appreciate your life health and loved ones and realize that this is a complete exploitation of REAL LEGIT HORRIBLE pain and loss and maybe consider please giving your $14 to cancer research charity instead of spending it on this book/film Catharsis is a natural human need/outlet but please step back and examine just how ignorant and misused this particular scenario is being presented this is real tragedy being portrayed as Shakespearean tragedy but it is not romeo and Juliet; it's not fiction and it should not be considered a romantic ideal; healthy lives are dramatic enough but life-taking cancer will not make your love and life better more real more intense or more interesting it will just be a terribly unfair unjustified pile of s*** on a plate in a random world where bad things happen to good people The real tragedy of Romeo and Juliet was that the conflict was trivial; two young people with the world at their feet died prematurally over a bs cause  Cancer HOWEVER is not trivial But also understand that while this diatribe sounds cynical I intend the entire half-full opposite; rather than celebrating this fictional bull s*** why not celebrate what YOU HAVE namely your health and the health of the ones you love Also if it takes a cancer-stricken teenage love story to make you feel/cry/release than you're a sociopath bc there is so much s*** in the world that is spontaneously funny and lovely and heartbreaking and awful that -with minimal empathy- are worth crying and feeling over instead And in today's connected info-accessible world it only takes a tiny bit of curiosity humanity and effort to find those things Tragedy does not equal depth of character The act of seeking depth of character is the only thing that builds it and I in my shallow existence am striving for that every day while knowing -consciously - that I have a long long way to go and believing -optimistically - that others are too
The Fault in Our Stars by John Green(hardcover 2012)What sort of perspective would an atheist typically bring to a discussion about dying the possibilities of life after death or about the (ir)relevance of sexual mores to someone who is dying This book's tone is pretty representative It does present a vivid window into the lives of modern teens (albeit atypical ones) dying of cancer and it does fairly well at critiquing the unhelpful things people do or say (with perhaps too much focus on Christians--p4-5 16) Once I was able to accept the extremely precocious main characters I found the book quite moving (I agree with other reviewers that the peripheral characters were better and more believable but not very developed) So in terms of catharsis and witty dialogue there is some valueBut after its critiques the book can do little to present a more helpful or uplifting perspective (although the reminder to walk lightly upon the earth is a good one):- And if the inevitability of human oblivion worries you I encourage you to ignore it God knows everyone else does (p13; cf 312)- Cancer kids are essentially side effects of the relentless mutation that makes the diversity of life on earth possible (p49)That tone will turn off many of the more spiritually-minded readers as will the crass language (Here are a few samples: 245 258 273 280) Also vindictiveness is pretty much condoned: 229 277 And lots of sexuality: 19 94 207 etcAs literature it is quite interesting though a bit heavy-handed Some of the metaphors (eg the grenade and scar metaphors) are quite good Here are a few quotes which may or may not be useful out of context (Spoiler alert)- pain demands to be felt (57)- I'm a grenade and at some point I'm going to blow up and I would like to minimize the casualties okay (99 cf 59) Only now that I loved a grenade did I understand the foolishness of trying to save others from my own impending fragmentation (214)- But there is no shortage of fault to be found amid our stars(112)- Even though I hated the sympathy people felt toward me I couldn't help but feel it toward him (132)- I'm not saying it was your fault I'm saying it wasn't nice (135)- 'I don't smoke' he explained the cigarette dancing in his mouth as he spoke (146)- Some tourists think Amsterdam is a city of sin but in truth it is a city of freedom And in freedom most people find sin (157)- You can't dump a girl with a brain tumor (175)-  He: If you don't live a life in service of a greater good you've gotta at least die a death in service of a greater good you know And I fear that I won't get either a life or a death that means anything She: That's a really mean thing to say to me [since she hasn't done much either] (168-9)- She: You say you're not special because the world doesn't know about you but that's an insult to me I know about you (240)- According to Maslow I was stuck on the second level of the pyramid unable to reach for love and respect and art and whatever else which is of course utter horsesh-- (212)- It felt like losing your co-rememberer meant losing the memory itself (262)- The sequel was a tiny thing to die for but it was the biggest thing left at his disposal (304)- She walks lightly upon the earth Hazel knows the truth: We're as likely to hurt the universe as we are to help it and we're not likely to do either (312) [Contrasts with You leave your scar upon me in all this and I am perpetually grateful for your influence]
I see I'm not alone in the 2-star rating category I haven't read any of the reviews and will take a general overview of why people thought this book was good as it interests me more than why they thought it was not good The tale of Augustus and Hazel wasn't bad but for me it was long drawn-out and repetitive I felt the story could have been told in 7-10 chapters tops Terminally ill kids fall in love; there's nothing surprising or engaging here and to draw out the story is to make a fast buck on the dilemmas of the ailing Then package it all into a movie and whiz-bang you're now making money off of the exact pity and drama that the main characters condemn The themes are: a) don't pity me and b) we are all human and fallible Yet the author makes bank on all of the above I dunno I guess if it's what the people want the reader is supposed to jump in and accept it But again that mentality is one of the very points that the book professes to be wrongI find the names of the fictitious characters to be annoying and distracting; and the pretentious dialog between all of the characters except for the shuffling parents is equally annoying When the quirkiness of a character's name calls too much attention to itself it's like having too much icing on the cake The reader is obliged to put up with the distraction throughout - and in this case for 313 pagesThe story started as interesting funny and engaging but then dwindled into a tale that rambled and whinged There are holes in the plot too which is aggravating The death and disappointment did not bother me but the rhythm of the plot was drowned by the entangled dialog and general sense of the author starting and stopping the flow -- not knowing really how to keep the plot moving evenly I had the sense that the author lost steam in the end and was by that point so entangled in the character intricacies that he didn't really know how to end the book
I read this book in one sitting yup that's rightone sitting  I seriously plopped down on the bed - cried and laughed a bunch and hours later looked up with a finished book in my hand  That being said I don't really think this is a novel that should be devoured in one go  I will most assuredly be rereading this sometime later in the year at a more leisurely pace because it deserves time for thoughtful pausesI can't touch on the plot without fearing that I'll venture into spoilery territory - so I just won't go there  I will say that both Hazel and Augustus are fantastically witty and loveable characters  Also I got a big kick out of the fact that the book is set in Indianapolis  Since I only live about an hour away I've visited many of the places mentioned (including Funky Bones)So I know that this book could be mistakenly lumped into the sappy Cancer Book category but really it's not  As Hazel points out Cancer Books have certain annoying epic tropes inherent in them (such as angelic cancer patients living their lives with quiet dignity)  The Fault in Our Stars is simply about the relationship of two intelligent teenagers who are dealing with cancer (well and about hopes fears life love art poetry etc)  John Green's amazing writing combined with his ability to realistically portray teenagers make this an extremely poignant read  This book will resonate with pretty much everyone because it deals with universal questions of mortality and purposeOriginally I thought to give this book 45 stars but after further consideration have upped the rating to 5  The reason for my original assessment was due to the Dawson's Creek-ification of the main characters wherein teenagers have a vocabulary that far surpasses many adults  In the end I decided I don't care about this because a) I wish more people in general exhibited a superior grasp of the English language and b) this book is just so darn good it deserves a 5 star ratingSeriously go read this book  If you're afraid of crying too bad  You will cry but it is absolutely more than worth your tears
This book shows a different side of the 'cancer kid' book genre The characters are well developed and original I like that Hazel is a little odd but very smart She definitely is a teenager with sarcasm and a little narcissistic I would recommend this book for any young adult or adult who likes to see things from a teen's perspective It is thought provoking but will also pull on your heartstrings
This story although a trick within itself is truly eye opening It took me a while to understand some things about the concepts but despite that I truly liked it It made me cry yes but it didn't actually make me feel anything more than hopeful that I can make my choices and feel the way I do about who I want to I have the option  to take in what this book has told me in a positive way So I will
I found the book to be devoid of hope and lacking class  I think it's been done before but better  I didn't like that the characters were rude sarcastic and potty-mouthed  As light and fluffy a read as Nicholas Sparks is I still think he turned out a much better version of the tragic dying teenage love story in A Walk to Remember than this is  I wouldn't recommend and I won't see the movie
Did you like Twilight The hunger games Divergent Any other teen/ young adult book When I read this book I laughed I cried I shared emotions with every character This is the BEST BOOK I HAVE EVER READ This is a ABSOLUTELY MUST READ It's realistic fun sad and just strait on wonderful I feel as if this is real John green has done it I pledge my love to this book along with my life
Even the title of this novel written by John Green has a philosophical meaning which has been extrapolated by a line written by William Shakespeare in the play of Julius Caesar'The fault dear Brutus is not in our star / But in ourselves that we are underlings (Act1 scene 2)The plot is very simple but not superficial because you will be the a magical cannula of Hazel you will be able to smell her breath her opinions and frustrationYou will live in Indianapolis in the United States with the beautiful name of Hazel with cancer of sixteen year oldHaving diagnosed with clinical depression your family will force you to join a support group where you'll meet and fall in love with the seventeen year old Augustus an ex-baseball player without a legThis is not a sad novel if you will be able to extrapolate the positivity summarized in the following passages:You are able to love Augustus intensivelyThe space around us evaporated and for a weird moment I really liked my body(page 203)According to the Maslow's pyramid you are considered inferior (page 213) and also by other humans like you for instance:Augustus Waters did not die after a lengthy battle with cancer He died after a lengthy battle with human consciousness a victim as you will be of the universe's need to make and unmake all that is possible(page 266)In my opinion this novel is suitable for young adults it explains the life of a human being they must be educated on this principle the summation of our sneaky racismCheersIP

This is a tear jerker for teenagers and adolescents  I don't mean to sound hypercritical of a lovely but doomed love affair between two young people  But this is not a book for adults  The angst we all had at that age is very well portrayed in this book  I know it's very popular and was made into a movie etc but I can't recommend this book for anyone outside of teenage years
I absolutely LOVED this book it was super sad that Gus dies and that u never find out when hazel dies but that is one of the reasons that I liked it it was like the book aia that was mentioned u never find out and u get to make up ur own ending as much as I like set endings this is an exception John green is a very talented author and can make a sad story a must read novel
I chose it for the fact it was about young people with cancer and being on the best seller list  The characters were okayactually liked Augustus and Isaac better than Hazel  However the deepness of the poetry and my extreme dislike for the author she was pursueing got a little old  It was an okay read but I'm not sure why it ended up on a best seller list
I suppose I didn't read enough about this book before downloading it I am assuming it is intended for young people or perhaps written by someone very young It is just too much sentiment trauma and teenage drama for me; but I only read the first few chapters before giving up on it It is now a movie so it may be very good if you stay with it - Just not for me
I was supposed to be reading review books But after finding this book for Roberto I asked myself what problem would it cause if I just read a few pages of this one I wanted to find out why Roberto wanted to read it Well that was a mistake and a half Not only did I not want to read any review books I didn't want to work I seriously considered not going to sleep My phone and iPad were monopolized by this book I drained both batteries trying to get through it in the shortest amount of time possible While guilt filled me for neglecting the other ebooksJohn Green's book was brilliant Sad yet so full of life Cancer has affected everyone I know They all have a tale or two some more tragic than others I have been blessed thus far by not having known personally a youngster who has had to battle cancer After reading this novel I'm wondering if I can still classify myself as being blessed The teens John wrote about had so much insight into life They were intelligent serious fun-loving and could teach anyone about how to live Their love for each other and the world around them was contagiousWhat can I say I laughed I cried And I cried some more This was one of the best books I've ever read John Green has perfectly voiced a sixteen-year-old girl who is fumbling through the first love of her life If I knew Augustus when I was 16 I would have fallen in love with him too This is a must read for everybody Just make sure you have some Kleenex in your pocket You're going to need it
In my mind it was obvious that this book was made for teen reading The hyper-focus on the relationship and cancer made it a little boring for me I prefer a lot of things to be going on I suppose It wasn't an unpleasant read I really only picked it up on the insistence of a friend and probably wouldn't have otherwise Maybe romance isn't my genre
Didn't enjoy this book  Hated the ending I can't understand the people that are saying this was a tearjerker  I've read tearjerkers and this wasn't one of them
I enjoyed this book so much that i even downloaded it own my tablet as an extra copy I would totally recommend this book to anyone who loves to read a book with a nice romantic but sad story This book definitely tells you the meaning of love as your read page by page This book is absolutely indescribable and the author JOHN GREEN is even more
too depressing
This book if a story about death life and love in between Most books have a happily ever after where they fall in love and live happy forever but this story doesn't exactly end all perfect The Fault in our Stars tells you that you're aren't the only one suffering from life toying with you pushing you down and knocking you over This book is mouth dropping heart stopping and just heartbreaking
I read this book in 1 day  I was quite disappointed  The movie was so much better  I do not feel the writer explored deep enough into the characters  Thankfully I watched the movie first so I was able to understand all the references  I honestly like the story and concept - just did not care for this writing style and again I do not feel the characters were detailed enough  I was left confused as to their personalities etc  Movie however was excellent and I enjoyed it very much
The book was wonderful I immediately fell in love with Hazel and Gus The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars was because I found it frustrating and sad that (spoiler alert) Hazel didn't truly believe in an afterlife She wouldn't at least visit the possibility that God does exist and seemed flippant and irritated when ppl showed a belief in Him
Cheesy Got bored of it really quick Didn't even finish it  Reminds me of A walk to remember Dissapointed
I'm not going to get into the philosophies of the book (they've probably been covered) so excuse me for not going into detail about why it's not great despite (at this moment) 13112 others saying that it is I'll simply say: I enjoyed the slightly caustic humorous outlook some of the characters had of their various forms/types of cancer but then Hazel just really started to get on my nerves She seemed to constantly use like I get that the book was written from her point of view and that she's a teenager but the overuse of like in the dialogue as well as the description/monologue was just like really like grating like yeah &lt;--- This isn't an exact example of course but I'm leaving it at this
First of all let me start by saying that I normally don't read romance books like this because I think they sound boring and after reading this book I realized I was right  The whole entire story goes like this: Hazel meets Augustine and he takes her to meet her favorite author then on the trip they fall in love then after what seems like forever in the hospitalthe boy Augustine dies  The whole story goes on about how Hazel thinks she is going to die and goes on and on and on about it  Some parts are boring but I can't say I hate it because I liked the parts about their friend Isaac who becomes blind from the cancer and about meeting the author Peter Van Huston  If you like romance books then you might like it though just nothing to go crazy about The fault in this book is the beginning  Where it says that if an ugly boy stared at her then it would be different then if a non ugly boy stared at her and a good- looking boy could be just as abusive as an ugly boy  Did you ever think of that
This book started strong and had all the right things going for it: drama; quick wit; exceptional writing; heartbreak  Unfortunately the ending was flat Disappointed  Wouldn't recommend
This was my second attempt at reading a John Green novel and just as with Looking for Alaska I found myself a little disappointed My expectations were possibly a little high or at least incorrect I came to the book hearing that ‚Äúit was not another cancer novel‚Äù By this I expected it not to be A Walk to Remember‚Ä¶in other words not to be overly melodramatic and mawkish to be generally more honestThere were several problems to me with the book The first is that I‚Äôm not sure how the book could have been more melodramatic and mawkish It is a roller coaster of emotions--trying to jar you back and forth just about as violently as it can I think that the author thought that some occasional outbursts of cynicism and despair would cover over the uber-sentimentality of the novel but I think that just added to it The second is that the characters are often frankly childish and even sometimes mean I guess that such should be expected--they are teens after all who live in difficult circumstances and so have a right to act selfish and moody But at the same time the tantrums and fits these characters display seems so at odds with the extra- extra- extra-ordinariness in everything else that they do I know that a standard critique of the novel is that the characters seem too old for their years (how many 15 year olds can start reciting ‚ÄúThe Love Song of J Alfred Prufrock‚Äù) but that didn‚Äôt bother me as much as how they are not more consistently mature for their ageThird it seemed like an oddly paced book There‚Äôs a big twist to the novel and once it happens everything is very very quick to the end I felt somewhat cheated that the development that went into the beginning of the novel up through the trip to Amsterdam did not carry on to the end of the book I will say that my high school students even though they tend to love the novel also tend to agree with me on this pointOverall I found this an occasionally entertaining book a teen melodrama that‚Äôs not as different from A Walk to Remember as you‚Äôd expect
I had heard that this was such a good book but I quit reading it after the 3rd chapter  I got tired of the bad language used continuously by the characters  Hard to care much about people who talk that waySorry but I don't see why people think this book is so great
I came to amazon today to redeem a gift card and was surprised the book I finished reading just hours ago was the first book on the site  As I looked through the reviews to see if others thought the way I did I came across one review that said a failing of the book is that teenagers don't speak this way Well I was handed this book yesterday by a teenager and told to read it  I began reading last night and finished  today  One of the highlights for me was the language The allusions and metaphors while sometimes a bit esoteric were leavened by the multiple pop culture references  I am fortunate to work with teenagers on a daily basis and they are smart Remember a teenager gave this to me  It is a pleasure to read a novel that doesn't pander to the lowest common denominator  More authors need to write at this level
I was excited to read this book because of all of the excellent reviews it was getting I can't say that I agree with them though While I thought this book was well-written I am not sure the story pulled me in as it did others This story is about two teens struggling with Cancer They befriend each other and of course there isn't a happy ending It is a very emotional book but there is just something about it that did not tug at me as I had hoped Overall it was extremely depressing I felt terrible for both sets of parents and of course the teens stricken with this horrible disease I don't mind reading about intense or upsetting subject matter if I can somewhat relate to the characters or feel some type of emotional connection but unfortunately I just didn't feel that with this book All I felt was sad
I didn't like reading this book I found it hard to get into and I am an book reader so will choose more carefully next time
I'd like to preface this review with the disclaimer that I do not mean to be jerky however my feelings in this review come from a place of wonderment at the state of emotion that come from bringing certain topics up in our societyThat being said something that I find so interesting about stories that deal with illnesses is that they seem to skirt the issues of being sick and the perks that terminally ill people seem to receive However John Green stands stoically in his authorship and calls us all out on our bull****Both Augustus and Hazel are made into optimistic if not angsty teenagers who are speeding toward oblivion furiously reaching out for a lifeline to keep them tethered to this world WhileI respect Green's writing style and story I found that the characters themselves are not entirely new to literature Hazel becomes the symbolic character that gets left behind once her boyfriend gets spirited off (no pun intended) to the after world and Augustus is the character who dies before his time Together their story while cute in some spots and heart-wrenchingly sad in others is not one that was fresh enough for me to fall down in total awe upon it's endingYet I can say that I was enticed by the idea that two people could go on this sort of journey together to excavate a story's ending from their favorite author half-way across the world Green produces this adventure in a way that's so realistic that I found myself seriously thunderstruck when I got to the scene where Peter Van Houten denies these two cancer-ridden teenagers their last grand wish At this point in the story I came to the conclusion that maybe what people like Augustus and Hazel really need is not so much our pity for them but our understanding that they are really just individuals who are just like their healthy contemporaries who are searching for life's answers Therefore the one thing that seriously struck me in this novel is that people like Augustus and Hazel are no different than you or I Like us their death is inevitable However unlike us they have a ballpark figure of when their final days are going to draw to a closeOverall I found the book to be an interesting and funny read with a light romance laced throughout the plot I would recommend the book to others as a conversation starter but not as a book that needs to be continuously read to understand it
it's ok but maybe for a younger audience than I am (age 65) too much like real life medical stories
This book was ok It's about kids who have cancer and that's sad but the writing and the overall story were not so good
This book was nice but I'm not sure if it really deserves all the hypeI was expecting something AMAZING and MIND BLOWING Of course the subject matter is very touching and heartbreaking but it was just lacking that 'WOW' factor for me personally
SPOILER ALERTThis was a remarkable reading experience for many reasons and the book deserves its accolades for the power of its characterizations but as a Young Adult Teen fiction author myself I feel compelled to offer a few words of criticismGreen's award winning book is about two young teens dying of cancer and yes as the awards attest he does manage to avoid most of the cliches and sentimentalities of such works while creating two of the most original teen voices in contemporary fiction Yet not entirely The love story is indeed profoundly moving and the unflinching honesty even cynicism with which these young teens face death is truly inspiring in part Unfortunately however religion or spirituality of any kind is relentlessly ridiculed in the novel and one gets the sense that the author thinks it is 'uber' cool to be so starkly atheistic and despairing when in fact such a stance is already a bit old fashioned Nearly every adult in the novel is portrayed as foolish and befuddled by life and of very little help to the young lovers themselves and that is certainly a standard cliche of young adult fiction Every representative of a belief in the afterlife is depicted as a self serving delusional fool Only the teens are clever enough to see through the the ruses and hypocrisies  of adult believers and to face head on the brutal fact that this earth is only a doomed and dying rock spinning around a dying star and we ourselves are mere molecules doomed for extinctionThis rather traditional teen atheism reminded me of a passage from Graham Greene's The Power and the Glory<a class=a-link-normal href=/The-Power-and-the-Glory/dp/114217686X>The Power and the Glory</a> which was itself published in 1940 at a time when such sentiments were indeed fashionable:In reference to the Mexican lieutenant who is doggedly tracking the 'Whiskey Priest' with an eye to arresting him (at a time when being Catholic was a crime punished by death in Mexico) Greene puts these sentiments into the man's mind:It infuriated him to think that there were still people in the state who believed in a loving and merciful God There are mystics who are said to have experienced God directly He was a mystic too and what he had experienced was vacancy- a complete certainty in the existence of a dying cooling world of human beings who had evolved from animals for no purpose at all He knew The possibility of a spiritual dimension to the human person a dimension that might be 'eternal' and might transcend the physical limitations of the body this possibility is not even hinted at within John Green's novel which I consider quite irresponsible for an author of young adult teen fiction Yes it is refreshing and iconoclastic in a healthy sort of way to reject all false comforts and escapist dreams and instead to face heroically the stark truths of human mortality Yet when dealing with young teens there should at least be the hint of an alternative viewpoint and the possibility of an argument for a more spiritual vision even if as an author one does not want to endorse that viewpoint oneself Fair enough  But there isn't such an alternative viewpoint in John Green's novel which makes the hype surrounding this work all the more disturbing Yes the love story is very moving so much so that I mourned for days after the 'death' of one of the principal characters) and mourned more deeply than I can remember ever mourning for a fictional character It is the great achievement of the book that the young couple come so alive that one grieves for their passing and feels their terrible loss But stacking the deck against a spiritual viewpoint mars the book considerably and in my opinion places it firmly in the realm of old fashioned outdated cliche all comments to the contrary notwithstanding Teens deserve better than thisBy a synchronistic coincidence simultaneously with The Fault in Our Stars I was also reading the remarkable 'near death' memoir by neurosurgeon Dr Eben Alexander¬†<a class=a-link-normal href=/Proof-of-Heaven-A-Neurosurgeon-s-Journey-into-the-Afterlife/dp/1451695195>Proof of Heaven: A Neurosurgeon's Journey into the Afterlife</a>Dr Alexander a brilliant neuro-scientist who  shared the convictions and scientific view of the vast majority of doctors and scientists - that near death experiences while certainly real enough subjectively for those who passed through them were also simply nothing more than the final chemical discharges of the brain It was a prejudice he was to see shattered by his own seven day near death experienceThis book is being lauded as 'the longest near death experience' ever recorded (seven days in a coma) and it is an astonishing inspiring story not least for the fact that Dr Alexander is precisely the sort of scientist who would have endorsed Greene's sentiments above He had no religious convictions at all prior to his experience and remained convinced - ala the prevailing scientific world view - that when the brain dies consciousness dies with it  Human beings  had evolved from animals for no purpose at allFrom Amazoncom's blurb:One morning in 2008 he fell into a coma after suffering a rare form of bacterial meningitis Scans of his brain revealed massive damage Death was deemed the most likely outcome As his family prepared themselves for the worst something miraculous happened Dr Alexander's brain went from near total inactivity to awakening He made a full recovery but he was never the same He woke certain of the infinite reach of the soul he was certain of a life beyond deathIn this astonishing book Dr Alexander shares his experience pieced together from the notes he made as soon as he was able to write again Unlike other accounts of near-death experiences he is able to explain in depth why his brain was incapable of fabricating the journey he experienced His story is one of profound beauty and inspirationDr Alexander should not have recovered at all from his coma let alone a full recovery with all of his mental faculties restored Medically speaking his recovery is nothing short of 'miraculous' and he now firmly believes it was for a reason He feels he has been  called because of his medical and scientific background and former convictions to witness to the nature of the Afterlife a 'reality' which so many of his scientific colleagues firmly refuse to acceptHis account of his spiritual journey into the world of the Spirit beyond death is the most profoundly moving rendition of a NDE I have ever read and it needs to be read to be experienced so there is little point in my attempting to summarize it I cannot recommend the book too highlyHowever two things struck me with particular force about the book The first is his sensitive account of the thoughts and sentiments expressed by his concerned family members and friends who gathered around his bedside during his coma and who attempted to comfort one another Alexander gathered these comments together after his recovery and they give a picture of a remarkable community of loving friends struggling through a terribly painful and distressing experience one which challenges their own faith and convictions The  comforting spiritual remarks they make to one another (not always with complete conviction more out of desperation and hope) are precisely the kinds of comments that John Green ridicules with such sarcasm in The Fault In Our Stars and reading these accounts simultaneously with Green's novel revealed to me in stark clarity how shallow and contrived Green's writing is in this regard despite his justly lauded success in characterization Dr Alexander's loving community of family and friends seems so psychologically healthy and well balanced and gives one a sense that they reflect the best of human nature during the most trying of timesThe second thing that struck me about the book is that during Dr Alexander's seven day journey into the afterlife he meets a sister whom he never knew he had (since he was adopted at an early age) but whose existence he discovered when he inquired of his natural birth parents after his full recovery Butand this is my point nowhere during his seven day sojourn does he encounter Jesus or any representative member of the Christian faith despite having attended Episcopal services with his family He states that the Episcopal Church and its services never resonated within his being since he did not consider himself a 'man of faith' and attended more out of familiar bonding After he returned from his NDE however he found he could experience a connection with the same loving Divine Presence of his NDW within the hallowed walls of the Episcopal Church- but still without any explicitly Christian content He had become a believer in the Divine and the Afterlife but not in strictly Christian terms Instead he saw the Divine expressed in a myriad of forms and traditions throughout human history and that viewpoint is refreshingly contemporaryI would certainly highly recommend The Fault in Our Stars to young teen readers but I would encourage them to also read in conjunction Dr Eben Alexander's remarkable memoir because the two books complement one another and the latter provides balance and perspective missing from the first
The novel itself is great but I received the book with a large scratch right through the front cover It isn't in the best quality especially when it's intended as a gift
Terrific

Must read
Poorly written and very predictable This book has been hyped up and everyone cannot stop talking about it I was incredibly disappointed The plot was almost nonexistent because of how predictable and boring it was (reminds me of a Walk to Remember rip off only much much worse) Read this book only if you have no imagination
Well written but predictable YA novel about death contextualized by cancer  Characters are a bit too mature and well balanced for their age and situation but this may make it a helpful tool for kids going through their own issues  I would not recommend to people with cancer as it may hit too closely but a good read for adjacent issues
While this book is full of wonderful vocabulary words it's so incredibly predictable and boring  It was a very fast read though so at least it is now over
My roommate's daughter had to read this for school glad I took it from her I read it in two days at work I would recommend this book to adults as well as teens This book made me realize that we may want to read what are children are reading to make sure you are comfortable with the material and things we are teaching our children
This was a phenomenal book  It is considered YA but so appropriate for any ages  There is so much too it; would definitely be a great book club pick too  I am hesitant how the movie could ever come close but we will see  If you buy this for a tween/teen in your life make sure you read it too and be ready to discuss it
As I have no experience with cancer I will not comment on that aspect of the bookI do however have an extensive background in the existentialist philosophical movement from the original trio of Dostoyevsky Nietzsche and Kierkegaard moving into the 20th century with Sartre Heidegger Camus etc As such let me be abundantly clear when I say this book does not contain a single thread of existentialist philosophyExistentialism is a view on philosophy from the subjective human as the agent of philosophical thinking It is also a ‚Äúno excuses‚Äù mindset; a person is always 100% responsible for their choices or absence there-of and as such the sole architect of their lives Consequently it is a celebration of pro-activity and the power of choice in one‚Äôs life; anti-fatalism In addition overcoming nihilism is part of the project of every existential philosopherThis book is absolutely fatalistic and concludes with nihilism; as even the title suggests ‚ÄúThe fault in our stars‚Äù ‚Äì this title reeks of fatalist; as it alludes to assigning blame to what one has ‚Äúwritten in their stars‚Äù It asserts fate and then complains about itLet us explore this fatalistic theme a little further; take the character of Hazel There are only a handful of examples of her taking initiative She is coerced into going to group therapy She meets Augustus coincidentally He takes interest in her for no reason He steers her to go to his house He chooses the movie He reads her book which then triggers him orchestrating the entire enterprise of getting answers about that book The entire plot is moved forward based on the volition of Augustus while Hazel only plays a passive role to the situation The only real initiative Hazel seems to take early in the book is to buy the follow ups to Augustus‚Äôs action novel series; this however has no meaningful significanceOne could argue that the existential theme is reflected in Augustus but let me tell you that he is no existential hero Augustus though driven on initiative is servile throughout the entire novel; like a slave He denies his own life by adopting a reactive stance to his new master‚Äôs desires He in essence abandons whatever identity he may have had at this point and becomes an extension a tool of wish granting for Hazel The symbolism of his servitude could not be any more apparent than when he uses his wish a wish bestowed alongside a death sentence to enact her desireHere is the irony; Augustus does in fact have one desire a desire he expresses is berated for and then suppresses culminating in his embrace of nihilism He wished to leave a mark on life yet he throws away his wish instead of using it as a tool to leave that mark Only someone who holds no value in life humanity itself would do this---At this very moment is when the nihilistic theme kicks in It is all meaningless nothing will be remembered in the future why bother This is reinforced by Hazel on several occasions and Augustus buys into it embracing nihilism and so throwing away his wish to a petty cause of finding out what happens to some fictional characters in order to appease his master; make a girl happy for 10 minutesThe full descent into nihilism is finally achieved on the very last pages of the novel in Augustus‚Äô letter to Van Houten:‚ÄúYou build a hideous minimall or start a coup or try to become a rock star and you think ‚ÄòThey‚Äôll remember me now‚Äô but (a) they don‚Äôt remember you and (b) all you leave behind are more scars Your coup becomes a dictatorship Your minimall becomes a lesion‚ÄùI could go through the various contradictions and general nonsense in this letter but the overarching theme is the embrace of Nothingness the ascetic ideal; nihilismNietzsche warns of this in ‚ÄúThe Genealogy of Morals‚Äù when he says in his final statement of that work:‚ÄúIt is absolutely impossible to disguise what in point of fact is made clear by every complete will that has taken its direction from the ascetic ideal: this hate of the human and even more of the animal and more still of the material this horror of the senses of reason itself this fear of happiness and beauty this desire to get right away from all illusion change growth death wishing and even desiring ‚Äì all this means ‚Äì let us have the courage to grasp it ‚Äì a will for Nothingness a will opposed to life a repudiation of the most fundamental conditions of life but it is and remains a will ‚Äì and to say at the end that which I said at the beginning ‚Äì man will wish Nothingness rather than not wish at all ‚ÄùDoes Augustus sound like an existential hero to you - Because he sure does not sound like one to me---Another obvious denial of existential themes can be found on page 111 with the letter to Augustus from Van Houten:‚Äú‚Ä¶and never was Shakespeare more wrong when he had Cassius note ‚ÄòThe fault dear Brutus is not in our stars / But in ourselves‚Äô ‚ÄùThe irony is that Shakespeare was actually expressing an existential idea; that it is not fate that dictated our lives but our own choices Fatalism is affirmed once again as the theme of the book---If John Green had any conception of what existentialism actually is and had read even a single book by someone like Nietzsche he could have produced something other than anti-intellectual garbageJust as an example Nietzsche‚Äôs theme of ‚Äòeternal recurrence‚Äô The idea very briefly goes like this:(1) Time is infinite(2) There is a finite amount of matter in the universeIf the above are true then there are a finite number of combinations of matter and once all combinations are reached they will begin to repeat The consequence of this is that this life will occur an infinite number of times; it is not re-incarnation but an infinite repetitionHow much more appropriate romantic and actually philosophical would such a message be Yes Augustus can die but his short lived love with Hazel will recur an infinite number of times ‚Äì throughout all eternityNietzsche‚Äôs poetic quote about ‚Äòeternal recurrence‚Äô from ‚ÄúThus Spoke Zarathustra‚Äù:‚ÄúOh how should I not lust for eternity and for the wedding ring of rings ‚Äì the Ring of RecurrenceNever yet did I find the woman by whom I wanted children unless it be this woman whom I love: for I love you O EternityFor I love you O Eternity‚ÄùNot only this theme overcome nihilism and the general fatalistic theme of this novel but you have a philosophical ending and overall a much better actually thought provoking ending---This novel is a crime against life existentialism and humanity; it saddens me how so few people are aware how destructive to one‚Äôs life the internalization of the ideas in this book can be ‚Äì nihilism usually runs hand in hand with suicide ‚Äì though not a cause suicide notes always have a nihilistic themeThere are countless other themes jarringly upsetting about this book; like the absolutely terrible portrayal of men ‚Äì from Augustus to Hazel‚Äôs father to Isaac; the shallowness narcissism and solipsism of Hazel to flat out misandry but I don‚Äôt think people care much that men are portrayed as disposable tools so I‚Äôll finish my review hereHope this review helpsIf you really want a book that will make you think and shake your core I recommend ‚ÄúThe Genealogy of Morals‚Äù by Frederick Nietzsche
This book was very confusing and a very slow read I guess because I didn't understand as well as more younger adults would I'm a teenager The book got really good toward the end I'm disappointed kinda it's not as good as I hoped it would be But overall I'm happy I read it It gave me a different outlook on life :)
This funny spirited love story will make you laugh and cry This book is appropriate for all ages I found myself unable to put this book down once I started it My children originally suggested I read it because I am a cancer survivor This book touched me profoundly and I honk everyone can identify with this story
OMG I  loved this book so much I am so happy I read the book I even went to see the movie and it was amazing also easily the best book ever and will become a classic I hope you read this book but it might make you cry but it was so good I would read this book 10000 times and I would still love it TFIOS FOR LIFE
I was really excited to read this book after all of the positive remarks I heard about it  I was very disappointed  The plot was awful the characters were superficial and I was glad when it was over  I can't believe they are making a movie based on this story
This was just an odd read  Some things were just plain weird  A lot of attitude and no belief system  It's not worth the time or money to read  The only reason I gave it two starts was because it talks about cancer something we all might have to face at some point in our lives if we live long enough

I LOVE the book Oh my gosh It can be so hard to keep in I was CRING it was so good The writer did such a great job I personally LOVE first person views and this was that cherry on top John Green wrote this book so well I recommend reading it to everyone 999% sure you'll love it like me
Sad depressing sorry I read it
True young first love is portrayed by the couple in such purity How does one love someone knowing that they are dying  John Green writes so vividly that you as a reader forgets the cancer but rejoices as two people love each other as fully as possible I could not put the book down until I finished
This book is why I love to read  So well written that from the first page you know it will be a tear jerker  Tragidy is that it ends
I have not been a YA in a very long time but I began reading books in this genre as a way of screening books that have received good reviews  before suggesting them for my daughterTeen fiction seems to be lumped into Teen fiction or YA fiction these days and that is a huge age rangeAnyway I was first introduced to John Green's work when I read his collaboration in Will Grayson Will GraysonI loved that book I have since read Looking for Alaska and now The Fault in Our StarsWhen I read the summary for this most recent novel I wanted to read it but I also didn't want to read it The idea of it made me anxious Once I started the characters drew me in right away and I couldn't put it downIf you told me I would laugh out loud occassionaly while reading a book about teens with cancer I would never have believed it But John Green took you into the minds of these teens and how they expressed themselves with anger humor and honesty as they dealt with their conditions; often more realistically than those of us on the outside looking inI laughed I cried I got pissed and really got thinking about life and lossThis novel is BRILLIANTAugustus and Hazel rock
I was recommended this book by a co-worker but the only thing that really stood out to me about this book was the endingliterally the last 2 sentences  Otherwise its ehhkinda cheesy despite the fact that the characters have terminal illnesses I guess I am just not a fan of teenage love
Dealt with a serious topic but went on and on and said nothing This book was recommended to me by a few people Very disappointed
I thought it was a good read not a great read I wanted to see what all the fuss was about so I read it Perhaps my expectations were too high It was a well written story of two teenagers with cancer I hear others trying to make it into an epic love story - sorry but I didn't get that
I read this book because a friend said that if you want a good cry you should read it Maybe I'm heartless but it didn't move me Maybe because my view on death is different from most Either way the writing style was really good and I liked the book it just wasn't what I expected
I had no desire to read this book not because I thought it would be bad how can you go wrong with John Green Mainly because I didn't want to put myself through a gut-wretching cancer novel that would make me bawl my eyes out But after reading reviews I realized it wasn't a depressing book (Hazel herself says that cancer books suck) So I read it and I did bawl my eyes out but it was definitely worth it I started at 11 last night and finished at 5 this morningI fell in love with Gus just like Hazel did slowly and then all at once The way he talked the fact that he was pretentious and vain but in the most adorable and hilarious way the way that he loved Hazel with everything he hadAnd Hazel was the perfect sarcastic teenage girl with awesome parents and the best sense of humor about her lungs and how they suckedMaybe I loved it because it's brutally honest but with just enough humor to ease the pain Maybe because I wanted to stay in Hazel and Gus's little infinity forever Or maybe I loved it because it was a fantastic story in every way possible Whatever the reason read this book
No teens speak this way The dialogue was not at all believable and the characters were not at all likable
A very sad account of teens with cancer  Well written but I would not recommend it to the young adults in my family  Teens have enough problems without them worrying about living with or getting cancer  Hazel and Gus helped each other cope  Sadly cancer took one of their lives
Watch the movie I think the story is better translated through actors in a movie rather than a book It was too gloomy and negative of a book for me I didn't get past the first chapter but I loved the movie Bring your tissues And the movie is basically the book word for word
Everybody said that it is a good book because it makes you cry But you also cry when you go to a hospital and see children with terminal diseases and it doesn't make a hospital a peace of art Reading it makes you cry but it is poorly written and the characters are believable
While I was aware of the subject matter before I purchased it this book was too heartbreaking for me It was a quick read but my opinion is that life is sad enough without having to add fictional sadness to the mixThose that like angst-filled stories will enjoy this book
I didn't like it Not a bit of it Of course it's only my opinion but the point was moot It held very little emotion for me maybe because I didn't get it but I still don't get it What's the point of a very sad story with no focus I wasted my money I do believe
This book is worth reading I'm 13 and as a young teen I find this book to be a great example of strong literature It's a heart breaking story of love and fighting for your life and fighting for love An example that true beauty really does come from with in FIVE STARS
This is the 2 nd time I've read this book; the first being a year or so  Going to see movie so I wanted it to be fresh in my mind  I'm so glad I did  I'd forgotten how wonderful humorous and sad this story is  Such a wonderful writer  Can't wait to see the movie
Really liked the book - it was easy to get into the characters and there was a good amount of appropriate humor sprinkled through this tragic tale  I know the target audience was much younger but as a grandma in her 60's it was still a good book to read

The book was good but I don't get what everybody was obsessing about Yes it was partially sad but I did not get moved by the book at all I did like the romance and the comedy though Was not up to my expectations I loved Out of my Mind  Try that for a mover
The Fault in Our Stars examines life and death in a way that I have never known It is beautifully written and truly calls to mind the indiscrepencies of human life and the universe that we live in I would highly recommend this book to all adults and adolescents
It wasn't what it was all hyped up to be It may be because I am 33 and it is clearly written for Tweens But after all the talk from young and old alike I thought it would be a book I couldn't put down That wasn't the caseI quit reading it about 3/4 through
Well written  However this was another ooops for me Had not realized was young adult  It belongs beautifully there  But not on my Kindle YA simply not my taste but I do understand why there are so many positive comments for the book
It was ok The book kept my interest but it's not one that I said Wow great book I do think the last couple of lines at the were worth thinking about but don're get why so many people liked that they made a movie out of it  Maybe this is just not my genre
This is a charming book but I certainly wouldn't call it complex It's almost as if the narrator is trying too hard  Or perhaps I am just over teenage snark as a way to express intelligence It was a cute read--even if it was about young people with cancer
Everything about this book felt like another clich√©d cancer book I wanted to stop multiple times but forged on hoping it would get better It didn'tBasically it's a revamp of A Walk to Remember with less Mandy Moore and more deadly disease
Run do not walk and buy this book  Its topic sounds gruesome and negative and downright depressing  But for those of us who have known this life it is an affirmation of all you think you knew and all you wished you could have said to your loved one
The Fault In Our Stars is an amazing book that shows how everyone can overcome their faults and learn from one another The protagonists are two teenagers who have terminal cancer although are kept alive by the treatments they are being given There names are Augustus Waters and Hazel Grace They meet in a cancer AA type group and become very close friends learning of each others illness struggles aspirations and finding a common median that comes from a bookBoth of them are extremely touched by this book however the story and meaning of it ends abruptly prompting them to search for the author They find the author who lives in Amsterdam and through miraculous events are able to meet him craving for the ending and meaning of his bookThis book is MORE than a what the meaning of life is It shows how all of us have faults and nobody is perfect Maybe just maybe our faults are predetermined in the stars and its how we learn to live with them rather than change them is what makes us who we are
One of the best written but saddest books I've ever read Loved Green's framing of Hazel's father  He was so compassionate yet macho The whole story is a tear jerker about teens  in love in true love fighting life threatening stuff Cool beans
Worst book i have read in ages Definately written for a younger crowd If I was a teenager i might have enjoyed it a little more On the other hand i do not feel that the characters had realistic dialog and the story was not particularly captivating
A very sweet novel about the ugly truth about life and dead no sugar coating; Just plain sincerity and love It's not about how long you live but what you do during the time you live the life's you touch and scars you leave behind Recommended read
You know it's that awkward moment when you haven't read a book but you know that it's going to be amazing just because of the author That's what I feel about John's books When i first became a Nerdfighter i was like 'ok so this dude also writes books apparently' I remember waiting a bit watching the videos of the vlogbrothers to get an idea of the kind of man he is and then he talked about Esther Earl and This Star Won't Go Out Fundation; well that day I got my mother in the deskroom and made her buy: Will Grayson Will Grayson Paper Towns Looking For Alaska and An Abundance of Katherines I had never heard of these books or read a summary but somehow i knew I felt that i would love them; and man i DID love them So when he announced that a new book was about to be published i didn't hesitate and pre-ordered it without knowing the plot For a few reasons I didn't get my copy and had to order another one; I haven't read the book yet but i do know that i will love it
Very easy read Good summer reading Characters are interesting and there is definite chemistry between them that keeps you intrigued Was a little predictable  but most live stories about sick people are I would recommend this to my friends
This is by far the best book I have read I love the twist when Gus died instead of Hazel I almost cried because of it I think whoever is reading this post I hope you will decide to read this amazing book üëèüòçüåüüíìüëèüòçüåüüíìüëèüòçüåüüíìüëèüòçüåüüíìüëè
This book was way too depressing for me  It's well written and the story is touching but the overall story is way too sad and I couldn't wait to be done with it  I've had several family members die of cancer so it hit too close to home
The Fault in our Stars is about a terminally ill cancer patient named Hazel Grace who is only sixteen years old After meeting a boy named Augustus who is in remission she learns to look at life and her situation in a whole new way I thought that the characters started off weak but a few chapters in I quickly became attached The story is strong and will leave you thinking about it hours after you finish  This book will make you go through more emotions than you ever would watching The Notebook John did a fantastic job in writing the book and I personally couldn't keep my hands off it and read it in one sitting (Which is a difficult thing for a book to make me do) I would recommend this for anyone who loves a book that will make you laugh and then a couple chapters later leave you sobbing Everyone I know has given this book a great review and has started reading John Greens other novels I hope you choose this book because you will not regret it
This book is depressing It made me shake with tears at the end But there are earlier moments of the story when you can't help but giggle out loud Just don't be in a public place like I was-my parents were looking at me strange when I spontaniously burst out laughing The characters really sound like teens no joke And the love story is so cute I didn't like how she thought so negativly-definatly not a repeat read for a while because I'll start talking/thinking like a depresed 40 year old menopauseal woman I didn't like the ending because 1-we all hated it lets be honest And 2-it didn't end @ Gus's deathit went on I was like WTF why doesn't it end at the sad part like a Nickolas Sparks book I say that because everything after the death made me start balling The death itself wasn't sad- but that dang reflection killed me Also your sad because the voice in your head knows she's gonna die soon too Bt I still liked it Buy and enjoy:)
Slightly disappointedI had higher expectations based on other reviews I am normally a fan of these types of books but read the book with the question When will something happen Just didn't hook me like I thought it would
I love this book so so so so much it is awesome I cried my eyes out when Augustus waters dies Hazel is inspiring and impacting to me and I loved how they met and fell in love  Some infinities are bigger than other infinities
I tell this over and over again to people and they still don't get that I really did not enjoy this book My twin daughters Fable and Grace (16) loved it But my 111213141517 year olds agree with my that it was cheesy and dull
The book was an enjoyable read  I plan to purchase it for my almost 16 year old granddaughter  It had some very good life lessons in it  Would not recommend it for early teens  They may not be ready for the life lesson of death
NO SPOILERS: just going to say that the book is a very good book well written and just expect the unexpected This book is very sad so if you do not like sad books don't read this one But I can't tell you enough how good it is
This was a beautifully written story about a very difficult subjecti felt present in their lives; watching it unfold from the sidelines Like one component of this book I would like a sequel to see how all did (good parallel)
The book was well written and I continued to read even though I really didn't want to read it  I don't like to feel sad and I felt at first that I would stop  I continued and accepted the message I just like lighter subjects
great disapointment Oh most folks love it but I hate it It is written for teenagers I guess and a movie has been made but the message is life is now live as you can/want you are going to die one day there is nothing but now

I was warned not to read this that it would only make me sad And i read it hoping for a good cry but it just didn't do it for me Still it was very readable and well written It sounds like a pretentious teenager's voice
This is a good book emotional sad happy but I don't think I've ever met any teenaged kid who talks like these kids do Overall a good book just really didn't like all the big words Seemed unrealistic for teenaged kids
I read this book at my daughter's recommendation and I'm sorry I did this book is so depressing If you're looking for a good tear jerker then look no further 2 stars bc of sadness factor and th he book had no ending
I purchased for my long bus ride to NYC It's a slow starter- writing style is different in a good wayI normally read technical self-help or non-fiction- however I will look into his other books for future reading
I learned a lot about young people dealing with cancer but the characters needed to be developed a little more At times the story line was shallow Perhaps the upcoming movie will be able to address these empty spaces
I saw the movie trailer before I read  the book  and felt like the entire book was predictable
This book is amazing and sad and made me cry half way threw till the end if you have a chance I strongly suggest reading it not because everyone else is reading it but because ithas amazing insight on many things
I am a girl  who is a freshman in high school and when my book pile was growing thin I got on amazon and looked up the highest rated  books This one seemed fair  enough judging by the description  and the first chapter so I got it and read it It took me about five hours to finish and I cried like an absolute baby It was so nicely written that I literally would sometimes set the book down and ponder a sentence or two There's lots of humor and tiny romantic moments but it kept me interested the whole time  I  read it This is my new favorite book (It beat out Twilight- my favorite books as of four years) and I've already lent it to a friend who said she loved it too I would recommend this to anybody who wants an amazing book to curl up with on a rainy day; I just advise that you don't read it in public or in front of family
I did not like the writing style and I don't like the fact that it is recommended for young adults Way too dark I read for enjoyment and their was nothing enjoyable about this book Just downright depressing
I knew from other reviews that this was going to be a sad story  After all it is the story of Hazel Grace and Agustus two teenagers that have cancer Although I knew it was going to be sad I did not stop to think that it would teach me some new things about life  Their story will give you a very clear picture of what it must be like for families with a loved one suffering from cancer  It is even more tragic when that person is young and in love and should be enjoying life to the fullest There were times when this story just seemed too real and I could not control my sobs so make sure that you keep those kleenex handy  I think that John Green did a wonderful job witing this book  Even though it is a work of fiction it did not feel like fiction in fact it might have just seemed too realFull review at []
Wonderful YA book equally suitable for adult readers Green's characters are convincing and vibrant The witty gallows humor adds to the feeling of realism If these characters didn't livethey should have
This book was amazing I LOVE that Gus was Hazel's lover They were meant to be together I DON'T like that Gus died He was my favorite character and he DIED Soooo sad LOTS OF LOVE FOR GUS ‚ÄîAbby Grier
Great up to the point where it becomes so unbelievable it ruins the ability to believe in the  story  Green seems to have his finger on the inner workings of the teen-ager however  Unsentimental
Are there going to be any sequels What happens to Hazel How long does she live What about Isaac What happens to Hazels parents marriage I need the answers Please let there be another book
I enjoyed this book It was very touching It really made me reflect on life What is important knowing many people but not deeply or knowing a few people deeply Read this story and you decide
This is supposed to be Young Adult fiction but don't buy it for your teenager if you don't want your young adult to be reading about two cancer-stricken teenagers having unmarried sex
I'm in a book club and we all agreed that the movie was better than the book  The movie made us cry and you could 'feel' the relationship between the main characters better than in the book
I just wanted to justify buying kindle so bought this book But soon after started reading I was hooked to story I will watch the movie to figure out whether it lived up to the book or not
I really enjoyed this book Even though it is a story about two teenagers the author uses a vast range of vocabulary It's hard to put down once you start reading Definitely prepare to cry
This was an enjoyable read that filled a transcontinental flight While the topic is not humorous the characters are entertaining and the dialog well written I would recommend to a friend
I loved this book but it almost dragged on for too long Maybe it is just because I was so in love with Augustus`s character that when he passed I was so bored But I would recommend this
I'm not into this teenage love story kind of thing This book was meh If you liked twilight you'll probably like this but I just wasn't into it It's pretty predictable and an easy read

What an over-hyped self conscious piece of ‚Ä¶well you know It's Twilight with cancer The plot is predictable the characters vapid and just plain unbelievable Can't believe how popular this book is Glad it was short
Not too shabby The characters were interesting but way too smart for their ages Though they were entertaining too read I wish they would have been more believable  Enjoyed the plot
Good read Funny heartwarming and tragic all in one The relationship between Gus and Hazel feels real like you're sitting right across from them watching them grow as a couple
Great book but watched movie first  Won't ruin but it is a well written book and even better movie  Happy with purchase &amp; if you're looking for a good read this is a great one
I liked reading it while working at the pool as a lifeguard while no swimmers were around Cool weather means read more books The book was cute easy to read but very predictable
I have spent the last year going through cancer treatments and I wasn't sure I wanted to read this book I finally gave in and found the story to be spot on and a wonderful read
*Fellow Nerdfighters please read comments attached to this review as a wonderful and unexpected conversation is unfolding Cheers TW WilliamsJohn Green's new book The Fault in Our Stars is flawed from start to finish To begin with it is about two young people with cancer If you write a book about two young people with cancer you have to write a book so good that it never relies on the reader's sympathy and compassion to excuse otherwise mediocre writing In this he fails The main characters are just too quick too deep too intellectual and honestly too John Green It reminds me of watching new Woody Allen movies and seeing Allen's worn out old rants coming out of a new young actor's mouth John Green's characters are starting to do this same disembodied authorial ventriloquismNow maybe this doesn't sound so bad I mean characters that you can sympathize with that just happen to be as quick and snarky as a wildly famous uber intelligent thirty-four-year-old author sounds like a good time in the YA reading room This is what Green usually does and he does it well I might add But this time it isn't enough to overcome the seemingly endless scenes where he gives play-by-play accounts of high body count commando video games (Yes John I get the metaphor But you once said that we don't need to intellectually grasp the best metaphors in order for them to work on us emotionally I believe that wholeheartedly--Hell I teach it to my students Unfortunately the video game metaphor in this book only works intellectually Meaningful metaphors have to work seamlessly and emotionally for the reader during the act of reading and after our emotions are stirred we can go back and intellectually discover why) To make matters worse the author in the book that the main characters are trying to contact is the oddest mixture of trite unbelievable and phantasm This poorly developed character randomly pops up in the latter half of the novel like a whack-a-mole Toward the end I was desperately seeking out the rubber mallet to bash him withFinally there are the painfully stereotypical liberal-arts-education allusions John Green has always been an allusionist He used Marquez and Wilde references to great effect in Looking for Alaska He gave a nice little nod to Woody Guthrie in Paper Towns but this time around Green goes shopping for his allusions out of the state college 101 offerings One The Love Song of J Alfred Prufrock--check One Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs--check The entirety of The Red Wheelbarrow--check Let's see What am I forgetting Well I better throw in a can of Leaves of Grass for good measure These are all interesting and wonderful things but hauling them out a bit early and out of context for the teenage set irks me It feels like Green is just trying to impress the natives with the mundane miracles from his own worldPerhaps the problem is that John's books are venturing away from his childhood experiences and since we are the same age my childhood experiences and starting to more accurately reflect the experiences of today's adolescents Maybe I need a little nostalgia in my YA fiction and maybe I'm just being a crank What I do know is that I was eagerly awaiting John Green's new book and I was heartbroken when I read it not because of the kids with cancer because of the great author who hides behind them
I loved the story but when I got to the last disk in the box it had a flaw in it and would not play past the 8th chapter I have not idea how the story ended Very disappointed
This was a wonderful read I thought the ending was quite surprising but felt it was just a matter of time for the two  to reunite in the after life; I really enjoyed the book
Everyone I know loves John green and although i can't say the fault on our stars lives up to the hypeit's definitely understandable why it's such a hit Definitely worth a read
Amazing Bring your tissues everywhere This book seems predictable in the beginning but give it a chance and I guarantee you'll find yourself wanting more just like AW and HGL
I loved this book &amp; couldn't put it down As a cancer survivor it hit close to home I felt a connection with the characters and really understood where they were coming from
Heard great things about the book have wanted to read it for a while It was easy to download to my tablet I can not comment on the book itself as I have not read it yet
An easy to enjoy book Well written Uses all our senses I found I had a hard time putting it down because I needed to know what was going to happen with the characters
I liked the story sobbed like a baby as the story played out  but in the end as an adult it's a simple book you will skim through If that's fine with you go for it
Bruno real minecraftSky is falling apart from that died in the end of slender mans series of slender and robbers and the nether would have been a number of the end
Well written Beautifully told story of cancer survivors and the emotions involving their family Although a tough topic the story is told with humor and intelligence
Although it was well written and intelligently captured the disposition of a teenage cancer patient the plot was sloppy and lacked any finishing moral or central idea
My wife was the reader of this book and this rating reflects her review  The author does a good job of holding the readers attention despite the sad topic and ending
I chose this rating because I thought it was an average book I didn't have to continue reading it for hours I was able to put the book down whenever I felt like it
This book got off to a slow start but then the more I read the more I got into it I really began to love Gus He was very unique This is definitely a must read
id ike to talk with all the people whow rated it 5 stars this book should rather target 10 year olds rather than young adults writing is way to simple and fast
this book is great made me cry 5 times and I still am as I'm writing this Though it is unreasonable to have 17 and 16 year olds talk like a college professor
My 15 yr old daughter asked for this book: she read it then I did It's amazing in so many ways--there are surprises and many touching and profound moments offered At the same time however it's an easy read and very entertainingIf you ever listened to the author speak (search John Green on youtube for his Crash Course in World History) you'll understand the wealth of information you'll be delving into -- I'm not talking the subject matter but rather the depth and breadth of knowledge and the true voice in which he writesHighly recommended and I have since bought other books by the same author
I didn't want it to end From the beginning I knew Augustus would be the one to die They were two amazing children I want to thank John Green for sharing them
It is definitely for teenagers  As an adult it simply bored me and the writing isn't particularly special either  Very predictable plot  Not my cup of tea
Fast entertaining read Characters were interesting Ending seemed a little rushed Recommend borrowing the book from your local library instead of purchasing
Fair story fairly unbelievable characters May be more relevant to teens than jaded adults  Thought provoking messages in story  Short read worth your time
The maturity level of the main characters is a bit unbelievable yet the ability with the use of a wonderfully descriptive vocabulary make this worth the read
This is a truly wondrous novel about young people living with one foot in the grave  It is the story about two teens with cancer and how that fact affects them their families and their friends  It tackles some of life's biggest questions: what it means to live and to love; what constitutes a valuable life; what constitutes a good death; and inevitably what is the meaning of life  The story is told with searing honesty  It will make you fall in love with the characters and yes it will make you cry  But it will also make you laugh out loud and have you giving thanks for John Green's amazing novel
I'm not sure what all the fuss is about This book is neither profound nor inspiring It seems like a great read for young adults but certainly not over 30
Excellent witty and well-written book for all ages Appropriate for ages 10 to 80 it's the kind of book which you'd get more from on a second or third read
Was skeptical of this at first Thought the movie was okay Ended up enjoying it quite a lot Interesting writing style Might have to check out Paper Towns
Whether true or not it could be  It'll be a tear jerker for most  I read it because I granddaughter suggested it and she was at the premier of the movie
Even if no one had told me that (spoiler alert) Augustus would die I would have figured it out It was a sweet story but (in my opinion) highly overrated
It is a very good book I actually cried when the young man died I thought it was very real and honest in its dealing with the terrible disease of cancer 
Book was good but do depressing at the end It's weird to say that considering you know somebody is bound to die but actually reading made me cry a bit
It was perfect so yeah yeah yeah I will eat u want u back cover of water and I'm sorry kindle stay in Korean peninsula in Korean peninsula in Korean war on
This is the only book I've ever read cover to cover I was constantly reading  I would recommend my friends and family to read this book  I love this book
I couldn't put it down Recommend highly Can't imagine the movie hoping it is good  eat pray love was the last book I read &amp; the movie was unimpressive
The characters in this book are very likeable in the manner that they handle their stressful situations which makes it an enjoyable experience to read
It's to hyped up
Good story but could the author not have left the blasphemy out I liked the story but was angered and insulted that he kept using God's name in vain
The book was good but not as good as everybody said I liked it but there has been better books however also some worst I'd say this is an okay book(;

it was so good I can't wait to see the movie I hope they do a good job I wish they would make the person die more at the end of the book though
I can see why it was so popular and I will recommend this book to my students but for me it was sadly just OK I liked his book Paper Towns more
It was a quick easy read but nothing special The writing was fairly simplistic and the plot was pretty straightforward Good for adolescents
This book was some incredible work from John Green It displayed perfectly the love and heartbreak that was felt and it really touched my heart
Got it during the lightning deal last year for some Christmas presents -- arrived in perfect shape and I wish I had bought two instead of one
Darkly uplifting John Green writes a no-fluff tale of a teenage girl's life with cancer and reluctant love  But this is not a cancer story
I love this bookperfect blend of different emotionsperfect story line showing the life and feelings of teenagers suffering from cancer
a nice story but I could have done with out some of the words and long details of computer games  looking forward to seeing the movie though
Maybe good for a young reader but quite juvenile  The writing was not up to a caliber I am used to though subject matter had some thought
Not really what I had hoped for and there were parts that were a bit out there but for the most part The Fault in Our Stars is a good read
Read the whole book but it left me feeling depressedjust not what I expectedclearly it would appeal to teenagersit felt incomplete
I would highly recommend this to later teens-and their parents too A good read;thought provoking but actually realistic in today's world
Amazing  I couldn't put it down and I cried so much at the end of the book  It's a book that you can easily get emotionally connected to
A beautifully written book about cancer not the way sad stories are traditionally told but how sad stories should be told the funny choice
The ending was good and had me in tears The writing just wasn't my style I think the style is definitely geared towards a younger crowd
Fantastic writing style but no plot  Would love to read more from this author if they had an idea for a book that wasn't so predictable
Just a great read One of those you don't want to put down but you also don't want it to be over  Chose 5 stars because it was that good
If we could be honest use our time better focus on life more without knowing death was even more predictable than it is for most of us
I don't typically get emotionally involved while reading a book but this one got me  I laughed I cried and enjoyed every minute of it
Beautiful book even though I wished many things where more clear I have to say that I loved every single chapter and could stop reading
I had so many unanswered questions when this book ended :(  I enjoyed the book all they way up until the end and then it just ended
Although I love this book dearly I was under the impression that I was buying two Limited Edition books based on the picture by seller
the story line was good  however the language was inappropriate at times which is why I have it only the stars  very unexpected book
I feel like Hazel felt towards AIA I wanted to know how her last days were How many more she had left I wanted to know that she died
I just couldn't connect with the characters and the narrative was amateurish The only think this book did good was to promote itself
This book is overrated Personally will Grayson will Grayson  : say better  BUT everyone has an opinion old this wasn't that sad tbh
One of the most emotional books that I've ever read def worth the read John Green knows how to jerk a tear from anyone Great Book
Great book lovely sad and emotional story but didnt have a huge wow factor about it for me but it was just what I needed at the time
Just couldn't get into this  Felt like teens don't really talk like these characters talked and much of the time it read cheesy to me
i have not yet read the book i know plenty who have and ive seen the movies and i just bought the book and looking forward to reading
Hundreds of pages of teenage angst and totally predictable plot Some nice turns of phrases though It's not an utter waste of time
I could not put the book down  It tugs at th  heartstrings with every chapter  By far the best quick read I've read in a long time
My niece loved it  She said there were really funny parts sad times and stuff happened which she did not seem to expect
Awful poorly written book with a completely predictable endings I honestly don't understand why so many young women like this book
I couldn't find a emotional connection with them (Hazel and Gus) but I think that's a personal thing but your writing was done well
Bad Very bad Not good Best part is when they died
Strong characters; unsurprising plot It's a quick and easy read but it's not as good as I was expecting based on it's reputation
Sad parts good parts some in between but makes this a very good bookI recommend this to all times of readers But about ten and up
I LOVED THE WHOLE THINGüòÉIt is so excruciating that Gus dies when they are togetherAnd that peter is like that
Also I enjoyed the philosophical bent on this book  I was expecting it to be much more emotionally moving than it actually was
What a love story The reality of life is ugly The Fault in Our Starts paints a beautiful picture in an otherwise ugly reality
OK basically sad book about two teenagers looking for an ending to a book they read that leaves unanswered questions  OK read
Sometimes the book took your breath away and others it was a drag but overall good experience Nothing wrong with a love story
This book was just okay and I managed to finish it It probably suits the young adult readers better Wouldn't go see the movie
I so was not expecting that ending it hit me like a hammer I literally cried when she got the call that Augustus died of cancer
Just a beautiful teenage love story teaches you to just live life everyday because you never know when will be your last day
My 10 yr old dtr read this and she said it was fabulous In fact she's looking for more books by the same author A good read
i really liked this book clearly i dont like  how Augustus died but u cant change the story i recommend this book to anyone
It's an ok book easy read  I think I was told that I would cry too many times before I read itdidn't find it that moving
The storyline is sad yet oddly sweet It's not a bad read but I was expecting much more Hopefully the movie will be better
This book was depressing but that's expected with this type of book  Not as enlightening as I had expected Just depressing
Good book for a younger crowd Pretty predictable and lacks depth but an enjoyable quick summer read I would recommend it
Got this book for my niece for Christmas I have heard it is a really good book by my sister and the movie was good too :)
Nice story Well written  Look forward to reading other books by the author  It was sad story but wanted to keep reading
Was interesting I really enjoyed the book I think it is nicely written And very intriguing I would recommend this book
Great book However I would suggest watching the movie first before reading the book or you will be highly disappointed
I hate reading but this books makes you wish you were hazel It is inspiring and enjoyable It's the perfect romantic book
This is my first Green novel and I found it clever and insightful Surprisingly humorous and not too teen age-y
I never got attached to the characters due to how quickly I read it and it didn't even phase me at the end when Gus died
This book felt like I was living the story I felt like I knew them  This had me in tears  smiles  made me want more
It was better than Twilight but that's not saying much is it now  Quick and easy read  Good airplane material maybe
I finally read this as I wanted to see what all the excitement was about; however I felt it was just okay
Predictable Def written for the young adult crowd but easy and fast read Was a good story I read it in three days
Amazon needs to address this Missing page 135 and several others The book is great but dont buy the Kindle edition
I may be the minority but I despised the book
average stuff not the worst thing I've ever read but really unspectacular John Green is a clever guy though so
I read the last page wanting more This book will bring you down to your most real heart string and then pull it
Great novel by John Green It was sad but definitely worth the read and tears And appropriate for many age groups
This book is a book that makes you wish all books were like it It is beautiful devastating real and provoking
This book was so amazing I don't even know where to begin  It's written as if John Green has experienced cancer personally (or has really done his research)  It's difficult to believe that Hazel and Augustus are fictional characters - their experiences are candid  It was unbelievably sad but I didn't feel as if it was exploiting the sadness of cancer just to sell books  Just a great great book  I can't recommend it enough
Pretty much a teen story  it  was a very comfortable read with a nice ending  Loved the author's writing style
It was a good book But the ending was a little predictable  But it was an enjoyable and thought provoking read
Bad and misrepresented  Wouldn't give it a star and like my money back  Really stupidNo no no no no
This story was so heartfelt so beautiful and so real It seems to really depict an understanding of true love
I Loved the style of writing Characters a bit one dimensional Story too predictable But over all a good read
A little uninteresting and you don't get amazingly attached to the characters but still it is a fun book to read
This book was for my daughter to read My oldest daughter had it on her Kindle She loves it and I will be next
Sweet story I wanted to see the movie but didn't get the chance Usually I have found the book to be better
I waas disappointed in this book considering it was made into a movie  Will not see the movie because of this
It was so sad  The writing was good but depressing  The trip was great  It ended not like I expected it to
The Fault in Our Stars is one of the most AMAZING novels I have ever read I won't spoil any of it but it's truly amazing and the way it's written just makes the story so much more awe-inspiring AND it was a signed copy I got the J squiggle and though I wanted the yeti (darn) I'm still happy with the signature In the words of John Green If you don't absolutely love it you can punch me in the stomach ;D

I will look forward to reading more by this authorI gave 5 stars because of its content and readability
Hard to keep my attention I'm a sucker for a love story but this was seemed boring Struggled to finish it
The dialogue was too stilted for teens  It way too easy to see what was coming no real surprises  Average
it was so bad of how the story turns out But i guess it was okay though i only saw the movie Really sad
I liked the book it was very cute I liked the ending it was very sweet I almost cried It's a great book
I loved this book so much I'm ready to read everything else by John Green This is a hands down must read
Read it in less than 24 hours An amazing love story about naive yet mature teens Loved every word of it
I rarely write reviews but this one definitely deserved one It's one of those books that you can't really put down At first I thought it was for teenagers and I wasn't sure if I should keep on reading but chapter after another I was getting more connected The book shows the real meaning of true love sacrifice and loss Thank you John Green for this magnificent book I was really touched
I loved it it kinda makes me cry it's so tragic and so romantical this book is way too awesomely amazing
This is definitely a 5 star book it gives you a reason to enjoy life and I just can't stress that enough
If this isn't my favorite of all the books I've read it is definitely #1 out of anything I have read recently The characters in the book are well developed and realistic I laughed I cried and about a million other cliches Seriously though I really did bawl my eyes out while reading the last few chapters of the book This book is worth your money Buy it Read it You'll love it
This book is honestly the best I have ever read It made me laugh and cry i couldnt put it down It's not a cancer book It may be about two teenagers who have cancer and friends who have cancer it is not a cancer book John Green is a brilliant author and a huge role model to me because i want to one day be as good as he is I would recommend this book to anyone I love it so much
LOVE LOVE LOVE THIS BOOKNot much else to sayGlad I finally read itFast shipping
This book is so so so good The beginning made me laugh and it made me feel like I knew Augustus and Hazel I am going to read this book over and over again I love it If you are into romances and comedy this book is fabulous I can't believe Augustus died and all I can say is my God Why I wonder if John Green was sad when he killed Augustus or laughed and had tea with Satan
The Fault in Our Stars was a predictable story It was sad and depressing at most times A quick read
I liked this book but it was very sad  I thought it might have a miracle at the end but it didn't
I was a sucker for Gus and a bit annoyed by Hazel and her friend Katylin-sp Katylin was too pretentious Besides that I liked the characters I was annoyed by the 'philosophies' and big language like other reviewers because seriously what teen talks like that Other than these things I was adoring this book Adoring it Until (SPOILER):What kind of a jackass tells you he is officially going to die soon only after he has had sex with you The fact that Hazel didn't slap Gus and curse him makes me think that Green has little respect for women or is too stupid to realize that they are not going to be ok with someone 'being in love' with them having sex and only then saying 'Oh by the way I'm going to die I know you love me but have a nice life And now I will actually light one of these cigarettes' Hazel did love him I believe but she was not angry in the slightest for what I saw was a guy seducing a girl into having feelings for him so that he could have a 'last lay' I believe any woman would have been furious and would have seen through his 'love' I myself am thoroughly furious by this complete lack of respect for love
A read that will make you laugh cry shake your hands up at the Universe and smile at the heavens
I loved this book  I will be reading John Green again  He writes beautifully with real character development and make you pause and think dialogue  This story completely absorbed me and I didn't want it to end  I was completely entertained and deeply moved by The Fault In Our Stars  I will not forget Hazel Grace and Augustus Waters  Thank you Mr Green
I love this book it is so greatüëèüëèüëè I really suggest your read it because it is üôåüíöüëç üíõ:) 
I thought it was a good read It made me sad It is also a good reminder to appreciate your life
Touching story and very well written  An easy read Looking forward to watching the movie now
This book had a great base but wasn't on my list o top ten It is a very touching story overall
I read the book when I heard there was going to be a movie I don't know It wasn't for me
John Green convincingly captures the voice of teens in this touching yet philosophical story
Well I have not read this book yet but I heard it's good very good I might cry Probably will
I must begin this by saying that although I've been a massive Vlogbrother fan for over a year this is my first John Green book So going into it I was super excited and also a little nervous I was afraid I wouldn't like it and it would completely tarnish my Vlogbrother loveAnd wellI still don't quite know what I thinkThere were some aspects of the book that I just adored Flat out- ADORED Let me tell you flailing doesn't even begin the cover it I might not have been literally rolling on the floor (hehe literally joke) but I was convulsing in my chair with laughterMy family thought I was going insane I have no regretsFavorite aspect of TFiOS: The writingJohn Green might not appreciate this but I think he might have just killed my Hey maybe I could be a writer dream I will never be able to write like thatAnd I'm okay with that Because John seems to have writing beautiful funny books pretty much in the bag I read TFiOS slowly over a week I'd read something really deep and wonderful and then I'd walk away and have to think about it for a while and then I'd come back for some more amazingness He proves that one doesn't have to be wordy to make a point I don't know how a man in his 30's knows so much about understanding teenagers so well but somehow he does Hazel and Gus they were just so right I loved them both I loved that Hazel was a sweet normal person without being annoyingly perfect or on the flip side dull and boring Please do not get me started on Gus Because he was adorable Yes I just called a man who smoke (metaphor or not I find smoking to be highly unattractive) adorable He was just that amazing I would also like to start a fan club for Hazel's parents mostly because well THEY WERE AMAZINGBasically I loved them allSomething that really struck me about TFiOS as a whole was that it reminded me of the first real book I ever read (I remember like it was yesterday) It was a chapter book told from the perspective of a dog named Spunky it was a pretty normal story-about-a-dog chapter book except for the one thing Spunky's little girl died of cancer And it was the first time in my short life I'd really had to think about cancer and deathI remember balling my eyes out I couldn't have been more than 8 years old TFiOS reminded me of the feeling I had when I read my first good book Those feelings were new different and they came from a place I didn't previously know existedThat is what The Fault in Our Stars did to meAnd it was beautifulNow that I've ranted and raved just like all the other nerdfighters and  everyone else out there who's intelligent enough to see a great book when it's literally right under their nose (Well I suppose it could be literally over their nose too if it was held right) I must admit I have a couple of things that irked me about the book And in my effort to strive to be a unbiased reviewer I shall share with you what exactly those irkings are Most of these are things that personally bug me and I'm well aware of the fact that I'm in the minority here Most of the them have to do with the end of the book so(Note: There's another spoilers free section at the end)***SPOILERS PROCEED NO FURTHER******UNLESS YOU HAVE READ TFIOS ALREADY THEN GO AHEAD AND READ******OTHERWISE CEASE AND DESIST***Unfortunately there's an aspect of TFiOS that I found well unfortunate And it's not something that's limited just to this particular book but teen literature in general I feel like authors feel the need to add corpus amounts of language and sex into teen books in order to be real Now I know a lot of people out there are just fine with swearing and premarital sex and that it's part of their everyday lives and call me old fashioned call me a prude but I just can't condone itI was fine with most of the content in TFiOS I was relieved that there wasn't too much explicitness and that the S-words were used sparingly  But then when I happened upon the one F bomb I was shocked Although I acknowledge the fact that if anyone has a right to swear it was Gus I was still  disappointedYou have to understand this from my perspective: I work in the children's department of a library I have 13 year old's who ask me for book recommendations I sincerely wish I could pick TFiOS off the shelve and give it to them and tell them that THAT is what amazing writing looks likeBut I can'tI know that John's not writing these for 13 year olds but here I am almost 21 and I still don't want to subject myself to harsh profanity Can't we just have good books without going through all thatIt would just be nice that's allOkay personal rant now done on to plot annoyances:1)I knew Gus was going to die I'm sorry but the moment they mentioned how healthy he was I knew right then and there he was the one with the death that was going to pull my heart out of my chest and stomp it to pieces and then expect me to go on living life It was a matter of simple deduction: You can't kill the protagonist John Green may be an artist but he's also a best selling author Peter Van Houten was not one so he can end his novels horribly like that John can't It's the cost of fame Also: It's a cancer book if no one died it wouldn't be realistic I'm not being callous I'm being realistic Cancer is just a way of speeding up our eventually demise Someone had to die2) You know the big twist in the end when Hazel finally realized the reason Peter Van Houten is the way he is I had been begging Hazel for chapters to realize that and I found it slightly unrealitic that she never after years of going on and on about how he so perfectly knew what it was like and dozens of re-readings she never once thought Oh he probably knew some one with cancer Never Really***END OF SPOILERS******YOU CAN START READING AGAIN****** RIGHT ABOUT NOW***A lot has happened to me since I was 8 years old the first time I smudged ink on a book page because it felt like someone I personally knew and loved was gone and I'd never see them againI've had to watch family members be lowered into graves and watch their loved one's curse the day when the autopsy came  back positive I've shared tears of joy with others when the scans come back clear and they're given a new lease on life I've seen a mother's drawn tired face crumble when she learns that her little girl's worst enemy is back again for the third timeAlthough reading the The Fault in Our Stars did dredge up all these hurts and feelings from some of the worst parts of my life strangely enough it didn't depress me It more made me sad in a It's like happy for deep people way I was happy that I felt I understood more what these people go through I felt like maybe I could be more understanding a better help that I'd knew now how to pray for themAnd I consider that a priceless giftThank you Mr Green
This book was not even a solid 3 for me  I would say a bit below average and way over-hyped
I feel that anything negative said about this book gets shoved under the whole ‚Äúwell they have cancer so it‚Äôs got to be depressing and heart-felt‚Äù and that‚Äôs just not the case To me it takes more than setting the novel around cancer (but it‚Äôs not actually a cancer book like all other books set around cancer are no way this one is unique and special and should be showered in praise) to actually make it sad and I think this comes down to the tone of the story and that if this book had one problem it would be the tone Whatever profundity the book has gets torn up between the ‚Äòkooky quirkiness‚Äô of the characters ‚Äòdeep intellectual meaning‚Äô and ‚Äòdepressing cancer story‚Äô If I had the call this book anything it would be pretentious The most nagging part was the deep intellectual meaning that Hazel and Gus were trying to push in the readers face and could have been done without abusing a thesaurus I speculate if you supplement lengthy words to a notion it instantaneously converts to something profounder correct It‚Äôs not a mark of intelligence that a sixteen-year-old uses such language but somehow Hazel and Gus get credited for it And it mixes horribly with the text speak and slang they use alongside it if the same person uses the word ‚Äúhamartia‚Äù and ‚Äúdouchepants‚Äù then I‚Äôm going to assume they're showing off Oh but who cares it‚Äôs so deep and artsy anyway Oh look script format This book is so cutting-edge it‚Äôs not jarring in the slightestAnother part is that the teenager characters all seem to have some rather brattish characterises The cancer‚Äôs there but it doesn‚Äôt really affect anything until the middle Hazel gets out of breathe needs to carry an air tank around (oh she called it Phillip isn‚Äôt she so original and quirky) and has puffy cheeks They behave like a strange mash-up of all the teenager girls Green‚Äôs encouraged on Tumblr but not like actual human beings outside of the internet It starts with Hazel being condescending to the guy who runs the support group (a minimum wage worker who has no friends only one ball and runs a cancer support group Might as well be dead) which spreads out to other people she meets as well You don‚Äôt understand what they say Feel something she doesn‚Äôt Haven‚Äôt read the same books Don‚Äôt get their metaphors Well then you‚Äôre not as intelligent as them Hazel spends most of her time wanking about how intelligent or thought-provoking she or Gus are and much better they are then the sheeple who can through life without reflecting on a cancer book that is no way a cancer book It‚Äôs just a book about cancer Kind of like this one Going to Disneyland when you think you‚Äôve got months left to live Cold fake and plastic Spending a chapter discussing how eggs should be eaten throughout the day and not just at breakfast Inspiring and quirky (and so stupid) Viewing a museum gallery online So deep (the rest of this is drowned out by art students across the world laughing)The pacing is all over the place at the beginning it‚Äôs a step-by-step of Hazel and Gus‚Äôs relationship with sub-plots stringing it together which makes the story very disjointed and unbalanced The few characters we interact with have a far more believable relationship than our protagonists with no cheesy metaphors about death and long speeches about said metaphors just a guy and a girl to which the strain of cancer torn them apart Hazel‚Äôs entire character started and ended with ‚Äúcancer angst‚Äù and it felt too much like it was the make the book seem edgierThis is a YA novel without a glorified abusive relationship and/or supernatural creatures but that in no way makes the novel itself a decent one This is a mediocre romantic novel the cancer aspect has very little to do with that For a book that supposedly saved the Young Adult genre it was still full of the purple prose Better Than Thou special snowflake protagonists which plague it

I couldn't stop reading this book  It was one of the best books I have read in a long time
It was a decent read but didn't live up to they hype I Won't be rushing to watch the movie
Great book As always movie did not following book totally Anyone who saw movie READ BOOK
Loved this book Totally recommend it enjoyed reading it I would actually read it again :)
The story was not as emotionally gripping as expected Although it was a sweet love story
My wife liked this book  It was very insightful about teenagers who have terminal disease
Great book I thought it would be corny but next thing I know I'm drowning in my own tears
You killed off Gus How could you do such a thing You just about ruined my day purely on the amount of tears that I sheddedI guess I have to admit that the twist in the story you told wasInteresting AND MADE ME CRY But stillCongrats and all that you just managed to break my heart through a BOOK
I loved it Just when I thought I knew what was going to happen the book surprised me
While reading The Fault in Our Stars I was suddenly struck with the thought that I knew why John Green wrote this book It's an arrogant assumption but the more I read the more my reasoning was confirmedMr Green wants to make sense of cancerOn the surface that's a lofty goal and a pretty common one Cancer is synonymous with senseless random suffering and coming to grips with that is almost impossible Presumably fueled by good intentions Mr Green wrote a novel about two teenagers both stricken by cancer in loveDon't get me wrong The narrator Hazel is charming and clever Her romantic interest Augustus is funny vivid and attractive Their relationship is suitably quirky conducted amidst skeleton art pieces and romantic Dutch restaurants There's lip service paid to the joys of reading and the fallibility of authors They speak in beautiful sentences that would look good cross-stitched on cushions (like those dreaded Encouragements that Augusus' s mom has all over the house) When tragedy comes as it inevitably does in John Green novels there's a build-up and a resolution a sense that the world can Learn Something from the life and death of a young personAll the while every one of the characters protests that there is nothing neat or redeeming to be found in cancer all textual evidence notwithstandingAnd this is where Mr Green's internal conflict shines through He wants to write an honest book about cancer but he pulls himself back because that much honesty hurts He can't let his protagonists be anything but flawless because it's too unjust to have a broken cancer sufferer The protagonists' parents cry but they don't get angry or divorced because it's cruel to admit that this is the reality many families face Everyone can pay their hospital bills Nobody suffers from depression or other associated mental illnesses Giving up isn't discussed Heck even the Dutch occupants of Amsterdam coming home from work or otherwise enjoying their evening take time out of their busy day to tell Hazel and Augustus how beautiful they look as a coupleWorst of all when there is death it is accompanied by Life Lessons that leave the protagonist wiser and confirm her worldview (Which to my mind is the worst kind of authorial indulgence coming from a man who previously said that pain doesn't improve the quality of joy just as the existence of broccoli doesn't change the taste of chocolate)I'm sorry about my upcoming harshness but it must be said: this book is dishonest It manipulates the reader's emotions in the most blatant way and crafts characters who are charming but not even close to real It uses cancer as a gimmick to sell philosophizing teens and that angers meIn short my two star rating isn't provoked by poor writing or a mediocre plot; you will not find either of these things in The Fault in Our Stars Instead I don't think an author should be commended for using cancer as a sucker-punch to the emotional gut or a way of making a romance look poignant It takes a brave writer to create characters who are human flawed and hurt and to say through his/her writing that it's okay to be shattered by a disease that is in the business of shattering peopleI'm sorry that I thought John Green was that author
It started off well I was pleasantly surprised to see the quality of writing was high for a young adult book  It is refreshing to think that maybe young adults could learn a thing or two from such a popular book And let's be honest I was just happy there weren't any sparkly vampires There were even some really good quotes that I added to my collection from other great writers However the ending was a rather large let down  It wasn't a horrible ending though it tried to be unpredictable it wasn't Sixth Sense unpredictable (though a book about children with cancer you aren't really expecting it to be I suppose)  So I was trying to place my finger on why I disliked the books ending and I was having the hardest time  Then it hit me I had such expectations of this amazing ending (and I dont mean a happily ever after ending just good in a literary sense) but it was a serious let down  By the end I was just like meh and moved on with my life  I was expecting a life altering ending and all I got was blah  I guess I expected too much and shouldn't have been lead astray by all the hype  Live and learn I guess
Predictable and felt like the author just tried to add on unnecessary clever sayings
I wanted to read it because of all of the hype but I didn't feel it lived up to it
This book is one of the best books that I have read it is sweet romantic and funny
Well I got this for my little sister and she loves it She finished it pretty quickly but she stalled at reading it at the end because she didn't want to finish it that fast She even cried when some guy or girl died I don't know It looks like she loved this book so I will give it 5 stars
Witty writing Easy reading Literarily intriguing Thoughtful characterization
I absolutely loved this book  I read it all in one day  Highly recommended
just a plain boring clich√©
I just finished reading this book I have read many of the reviews and can't add anything more to what has been said except that I also laughed and cried especially cried I just had to add my 5 stars Thank you John Green for Hazel and Augustus I won't forget them anytime soon
This book was everything I thought it would be Beware it is a page flipper
Definitely my favorite book that I have ever read Also one of the saddest
My 12 year old is dying to read this and I'm going to have to say no because of all the sex talk and the fact that they have sex  Guess what Mr Green you can write a moving realistic incredible romantic teen novel without crass sexual talk and actual sex  I also found the characters to be unrealistically gifted in their use of the English language  That being said as an adult I found the novel intriguing and thought provoking but overall disappointing due to the aforementioned
This is the first book that I have read by this author  I was not sure if I was going to like reading a book about teenagers with cancer but I truly enjoyed it  It was easy to relate to the characters and their snarky attitudes  I can't wait for the movie

Excellent book good choice  Arived on time and in excellent condition
I don't understand how this book got five stars  It was written well in my opinion but the teens seemed so mentally unnatural  Cancer or no I've never met a teen like that I had heard that this book is a tearjerker  Not so for me  It was very shallow
So many people talked about this book that i thought I might like it  Unfortunately even though it is very well written I found it depressing and a complete downer  I want to be uplifted by what I read and this topic cold not come close to that goal
Maybe I'm too old for this book Thought it was childish and predictable At least I won't have to waste money on the movie
Didn't care for the authors style of writing the story line was good
Sad poignant and powerful book about true love in the face of dying
I could gush all day about how magneficent I found this book but I'll just let everyone else do that I want to say that although a sad face is put on this book for the first few pages this will make you feel all of the things I know I felt them
Didn't like it at all Everybody was raving about it so I thought I'd give it a try but had to force myself to finish it Didn't find the characters realistic at all or even relatable Thought it was very predictable But that's probably just me
I couldn't put it down It's funny sad and romantic It's amazing
I did not care for this book  It did not hold my interest Sorry
This was my first book by John Green and I loved it Two days and I was completely finished looking for more books like this one Appeals to all ages reccommended to me by my 8th grade student This will not be my last book by Mr GREEN
Truly one of the most well written books that I have ever read
A must read after reading The Fault In Our Starts Very good
Very powerful and accurate  Lovely moving and comforting
Ok I just don't get all the glowing reviews for this book  I admit I read it in it's entirety in a day it was an easy and somewhat engaging read based on the plot  However I found the characters sounrealistic  It was very difficult to connect to these characters  More importantly knowing this was YA readng material I was extremely repulsed by the sexuality within this novel I mean teenage girls are the target audience here and this book fully condones premarital sex and actually glorifies it  I particularly recall discussions of sex and riding him all night or something to that effect This book just left a bad taste in my mouth and didn't sit well with me  Aside from the in-your-face-sex I just didn't find anything believable about the characters The long sappy drawn out rambling self- reflections of these characters were so incredibly over the top All of it I just didn't connect
The story really drags inducing more yawns than interest
This book is so hard to put down I started it yesterday and have just fallen completely in love with Green's writing and these characters Definitely going to recommend this to all of my friends
There was too much cussing And it was very depressing
A little slow on the startbut good yard chair book
Fast read I thought it was a bit predictable though
Horrible manipulative emotional drivel great for teens who want to cry  Very bad for teens suffering from terminal illness  Could make them feel inadequate because it's so unrealistic
This book is frackin amazingly Awesme with a capital a John Green is my favorite author and he never fails me I highly highly HIGHLY recommend to read this Its undoubtfully beutiful
Fabulous novel  Quick read I couldn't put it down
Boring and cheesy I wish I could get my money back
A decent book but geared more towards young adults
Such a quick captivating read  Really enjoyed it
The Fault In Our Stars tells the story of a teenager with cancer as she falls in love with another cancer patient This book is honest and deep while still staying light&lt;&gt;
four stars - :I couldn't stop crying the end of it
Very fast shipping Can't wait to start reading it
Quick easy read A bit superficial and predicable
Loved the book  I cried and laughed mbo- mw
I finally got around to reading this last night What a bleak outlook on life and eternityThe story is engaging and terminal cancer patients do tug at ones heart strings; I never even came close to crying though The writing and vocabulary is at a middle/high school level but the author throws in obscure words (hamartia for one but its explained) and doesn‚Äôt ever talk down to his audience I think that‚Äôs perhaps why so many YAs love this book The author deals with big issues but with candor and grittiness but also lighten things up with laugh out loud wittinessBut boy do those kids need their mouths washed with soap I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôve ever read a book with so much bad language Which is a sad reflection on American society because I highly suspect that‚Äôs how a lot of teens talk Though I highly doubt that even a small fraction could use the college and graduate level vocabulary Augustus and Hazel use and launch into very prosaic and philosophical monologues they way they do especially if they aren‚Äôt widely and well read individuals just as these two aren‚Äôt**Spoiler alert ‚Äì not really you probably heard by now** Augustus and Hazel have sex Just a short time after their first kiss Which is another sad reflection on American society Why is it assumed that having sex is the only way to prove/show how in love or committed a couple is That‚Äôs baloney Especially if the couple is in high school God has good reasons for forbidding sex outside of marriageBrains are amazing organs and one of the neurochemicals it releases during sex is dopamine which makes you feel good it creates an addiction to that feeling To use Dannah Gresh‚Äôs words from her book What are you Waiting for The one thing no one ever tells you about sex:Dopamine emotionally ‚Äúattaches‚Äù you to the source of pleasure ‚Äì even if that source is ‚Äújust a friend‚Äù ‚Ä¶ The limbic system was created to store sexual memory and emotion for us A little walnut-sized mass called the thalamus‚Ä¶is the seat of our romantic ‚Äúheart‚Äù The purpose of the limbic system and dopamine is to turn the visceral drives of passion into a deep lasting attachment ‚Äì into knowing and being known But when this gets misused our system becomes confused and we feel great pain (p42)Out of the 33000+ reviews here on Amazon only 104 mention that the teens (who are underage by the way) have sex (As of when I wrote this) And well over half of those were 4 or 5 star reviews Also Hazel‚Äôs friend Kaitlyn says some very crude things when she finds out Augustus and Hazel are (semi) datingParents &amp; teachers read this if you‚Äôve got YAs in your life that love it (or will read it) and if you need to keep up with pop culture otherwise don‚Äôt bother
The young adult genre of literature has undergone a redefinition in the past decade or so These days if you don't have a dragon vampire or dystopian fight to the death you're not YA But people forget that Catcher in the Rye was YA as was To Kill a Mockingbird Tom Sawyer and Huck Finn The Fault in Our Stars is traditional YA which simultaneously makes it difficult for an adult to classify as well as critique because the competition (the greatest works of our literary tradition) is so fierceI was not impressed with the first half of the novel so if you find yourself with one of those reviewers who only read the first 100 pages or so of any book their impression may be skewed Picture Dawson's Creek but instead of Dawson and Joey just being cancerous they actually have cancer Hazel and Augustus meet in a support group Augustus is in remission after losing half a leg to osteosarcoma while Hazel - though not officially in remission - has beaten lung cancer for years longer than expected due to a miracle drug though at the cost of having to wheel an oxygen tank around wherever she goesThey are predictably falling for each other even though Hazel is playing hard to get (remember Joey in the first season and a half of Dawson's) trying to minimize the collateral damage her eventual death will cause She already worries that her death will bring the end of her parents through either divorce or worse and this is one of the only redeeming qualities to our narrator in the early parts of the book Augustus eventually whittles her down thanks to a shared interest in an esoteric novel and a sentimental frankly unnecessary journey to Amsterdam to meet the book's author and get some answers to the fictitious novel's abrupt ending Circumstances force Hazel and Augustus to group up from their snarky selves in the second half while the book comes to its inevitable but moving conclusion The typical reader will love Augustus throughout but your patience with Hazel nearly runs out before she redeems herself at the end Unfortunately you're stuck with her as your narrator through the entire course of the bookStars is the best-reviewed book of 2012 so far The author John Green has a rabid online fanbase and they have predictably flooded Amazon with positive reviews but the New York Times and your other old reliables also found themselves tripping over their tongues with praise It's not a bad book and I would actually love to use it in the classroom one day The prose especially the vocabulary is quite advanced and most teenage readers would find it challenging I feel the buzz it is receiving as a genre-breaker is unwarranted though Maybe it just can't compete with the books it's being compared to Maybe after the string of books I've been going through recently my tastes have become more discerning But to me this is one young adult book best left to the young adults They will appreciate it more[]
this book doesnt even deserve a star first of all the fact that teenagd girls are gettibg obsessed with books kind if bothers me girls are typically liking music not a bunch of stupid pieces of paper about a completely and totally fake love story this book does not deserve popularity or a movie the teenagers with actual cancer who are actual people deserve to be noticed anyone ever hear of talia she is the true person people should start liking she showed hope and perseverance when things didnt look good all this book did was make tenage girls feel like complete loners because no one Augustus waters will ever be part of their life so listen up all of  the people who actually liked this book (i hhonestly have no idea why you would) DO NOT OBSESS OVER  BOOK ITS  STUPID BUNDLE  OF PAPERS  YOU WILL NEVER EVER MEET ANYONE LIKE AUGUSTUS WATERS SO GET IT OUT OF YOUR MIND all i have to say that society sucks
Great book Highly recommended for people of all ages (not just teenagers or cancer patients)The serious subject is counterbalanced with a lot of witty humor
Great story not at all how I expected it to end
It was good but a little parts that weren't good
It's an adult book but I'm in 6th grade I fell in love at page 3 And some people say the first paragraph was bad that's just the starting Trust me you will love it
The book started okay but the whole trip to Amsterdam was unbelievable  It seems to be written by someone who has never been there or travelled with a sick person
Typical teem geared book with a tragic ending
Best book I've read sad and good parts but it was overall great I wish it didn't end my favorite quote was  a desert wish a ocean curse
Decent movie but the book was WAY better
Terrible book
Nothing like I expected based on the hype
I got this suggestion from the AARP magazine  If you enjoyed The Hungar Games series you will proably find this book a good read  I did
I'd rather my daughter have Bella from Twilight as a role model than my son having Augustus Waters as one Putting an unlit cigarette in your mouth and calling it a metaphor seriously If the main characters were 60 year old retired professors they'd still be annoyingly pretentious not to mention completely unbelievable I checked out John Green's youtube videos after trying this book and I can tell you that the author really put himself into his work
My #1 john green book highly recommend
Didn't see what all the fuss was about
I don't like the book so far Overrated
This is a very inspiring story a must read for teens and adults alike  I would recommend buying a copy and reading it for yourself
The book makes you feel all of the things Really that's all you need to know about it Go read it and don't forget to be awesome
9th book read in 2012Number 19 out of 241 on my all time book listFollow the link below to see my video review:[]
Amazing story of strength and courage
Well written great plot a must-read
I LOVE THIS BOOK This story barely relates to mine but I just cried when Gus diedI really am glad and her fell in love
I thought it was super boring It was sad and all but I skipped over a lot of parts It was just a little to weird for me
It's basically twilight with cancer

Amazing This is a fantastic book
Easily the best book of all time
not that great but a good read
Good book for 6th grade student
I got In about a chapter an d to tell you the truth I pretty much hated it It's not that it  wasn't well written because it was the reason was that it mad me feel depressed I really should not have bout this book but everyone else liked it so what the hay This is not a trash talk but just a warning you should try a sample first and then get the book
Bought this book for my daughter for Christmas because she raved about John Green and was thrilled that all pre-orders came signed She has read everything that he has written so far and is a big fan because he is one of the founders of the Nerdfighters check them out
Saddest book but worth the read
Certainly not my type of book
Predictable but not a bad read
Great book and fast shipping
This book was a bit boring
Great book Quick read
So sad but an amazing book
Nine pages in I knew John Green couldn't write himself into every pseudointellectual quirky/cool male character without creating a female protagonist who thought like every high school girl who rejected himWhen Augustus intensely watches her from the moment she enters support group Hazel explains: Look let me just say it: He was hot A nonhot boy stares at you relentlessly and it is at best awkward and at worst a form of assault But a hot boywellThis shallow backlash myth circulates every time a woman tries to clarify how inappropriate attention like catcalling or pursuit by someone you've turned down doesn't feel flattering Even young women like Hazel know the potential of assault enough not to trivialize an annoyance like staringJohn also doesn't understand how female friends work either Almost all the dialogue from Kaitlyn is ridiculous exaggerated like the other characters but vacuous commentary on shoes and boys the way popular media imagines all teenage girls having no inner life She turns serious only to ask about Augustus If she and Hazel never visited the mall their friendship wouldn't have passed the Bechdel test (Does the work of fiction feature at least two women who talk to each other about something other than a man)An unreliable narrator can only take so much blame John Green I read TFIOS wanting to like it having enjoyed his other books and been angsty and pretentious myself in adolescent courtship But I didn't need obvious (and obnoxious) metaphorical resonances explained each time a Mary Sue lead or the self-congratulatory streak against other fictional cancer books
This book was more for a child of 14-18 There were a lot of silly things about a book some old man wrote The girl talked about the book too much It was just boring from beginning to the end I only finished it because once I start a book I just read it to the end even if it sucks
not as good as anticipated
Didn't even finish reading
Well written  Depressing
Teen fiction Nothing new
It stirs the readers soul
I didn't find this book interesting The plot was completely predictable and the characters were boring and didn't seem like real people Felt like the author was just trying to write out a bunch of 'inspirational' quotes and had to add some story (I guess) to glue it all together
BUGS CAME OUT OF MY BOOK
Could not play returned
Great buying experience
Awesome book loved it ‚ù§Ô∏è
Very sad but very good
Good book Easy ready
LOVE LOVE LOVE IT
was not my cup of tea
I didn't finish reading this book  Couldn't get interested in it
terrible ending :(
Couldn't out it down
Great teenage read
Best Book Ever
It is a good and easy read for teenagers  But something's missing to be a great read  I knew that the story was going to be kind of cliche but I bought it expecting to find a surprise such as a compeletely new point of view about life and death fresh ideas or something deeper  Unfortunately it remained cliche until the end The novel is well-written but I found nothing extraoridinary in it  I'd read so many positive reviews and praises on the book but I think it is a little overrated  Barely satisfied kind of disappointed
okaynot great
Wonderful story
Was as expected
Wonderful book
just ask tumblr
Went on and on
Very enjoyable
Sweet sad story
It left me with alot of unanswered questions
I really liked this book for a while Then it seemed all too familiar Girl has cancer doesn't want to hurt boy etc Sure there was a twist towards the end but you could kind of see it coming The author was poetic and deep or whatever but the moral of the story sucked I love a good tragedy but this book was pretty hopeless The characters weren't very realistic either Definitely don't plan on seeing the movie
Like the book
Best book ever
Fast shipping
Not very good
Tear jerker
Ghastly  Not believable characters are so annoying  I cannot believe this book and movie are so popular
I like to read different things My mistake this is not how I see life or post life Too crude and sad
I love this book It's the perfect love story I would give it 5 stars because it's so romantic And it has a twist in the end that nobody would expect to happen I would recommend this book to anybody who loves romantic funny books I cried at the end because I was so shocked But I loved the book and I can't wait to see if the movie is as good as the book
Great read
Great book
There were many faults in this book not just the stars I really felt this book left too many important questions unanswered like if Augustus wanted to be a normal guy and choke out hazel during sex could he just take off her oxygen Also I've heard if a man has sex with a one legged woman it's supposed to be amazing because of the increased positions you can now accomplish with one leg out of the way Is there an inverse relationship to the greatness of sex if the guy is missing a leg because of decreased mobility Spoiler alert this is pretty much Twilight with a cancer kicker
ISBN-10: 1494983095ISBN-13: 978-1494983093Please check out my book with the numbers above Sure you will find it interesting just like John Green's
Do not read this book if you want to see the movie called The Fault in Our Stars The plot is almost identical There should have been a spoiler alert on the cover Highly irresponsible of the publishers
I as an adult have no problem with a book about a child with cancer and I think it's great to have a support group for the YA to have a chance to share their thoughts and fears  The reason for the 2 stars is tell me WHY there needs to be physical sexual conversations and actions taking place  WHAT does it REALLY lend to the story  I'll answer that nothing  Taking a warm story about two YA with health issues and that they can find some friendship through all this  That's great  But to throw in sexual needs on page 18-19; totally unnecessary  I will not be purchasing this book for YA to read  It's sad that some authors of books for today's Youth feels the need to throw in sexual descriptions  There is no need nor place on my book shelves for this trash  VERY VERY disappointing
My friends insisted that I read The Fault in Our Stars It's a teen book but still deep These rumors are true However my friends also gave me a 100% guarantee that this book would change my life While this may be true for some it wasn't for me and here's whyThe fault In Our Stars deals with the issues of mortality in the eyes of a cancer ridden teenage girl John Green does a great job of accurately portraying teen angst and even what a girl generally thinks The book shows loving parents disease life love death and how the characters deal with it all It was well doneHowever the other half of the book consisted of romance The two main characters were bonded through simply spending time together and their love of a book Overall I felt their relationship needed more development If they had not had cancer and fear of death their relationship might not have been as strong Some may say that is the point But because of that I personally was not interested in the characters falling in love or not Since their romance is a good chunk of the book I had trouble being fully interested
Classic John Green in that it is smart dry humor and also poignant I bought it for my self and a student and we are doing a little book club She LOVED it and has read it several times in the week I gave it to her As an adult I don't LOVE it but as a teacher I really do
******SPOILER ALERT**This book OH MY STARS (see what I did there)This book is amazing intellectual hysterical heart-breaking real and I could go onBecause of her cancer Hazel lives pretty much solely in the world of books and television She's incredibly smart and funny but doesn't really have any friends anymore In an effort to get her to make some Hazel's mother forces her to go to what is probably the most depressing support group in existence There she almost kinda sorta becomes friends with a boy named IsaacOne time Isaac brings his friend Augustus Waters and that's pretty much all it takes to get this story going Augustus is attracted to Hazel for her mind Because she's really smart remember He's the bold upfront tell-it-like-it-is kind of guy After about a page or so of witty banter he invites her to his house They become friends instantly bonding over a bookThis book kinda becomes a mini theme inside The Fault in Our Stars It's so closely related to the original story that you have to wonder if sometimes Hazel doesn't forget it's not part of her own lifeThrough the local make-a-wish foundation the Genie Foundation Augustus qualifies for a wish His wish takes him and Hazel across the world to Amsterdam to meet the author of the book They have questions ones that only he can answer But he refuses Now whatTo Hazel it appears that her stars just aren't lining upThe book takes a dramatic turn for the worse and she begins to wonder if maybe life isn't about being noticed by the universe maybe life is about noticing the universeEveryone told me that I would cry my eyes out during this book Which was probably totally accurate because I cry over virtually everythingNeedless to say I didn't cry I came close though Several timesThe characters had a way of turning their crap luck into a humorous occasion The way they dealt with the pain was by making jokes And they were funny as heck So just like them I was saved from crying by the humorReally though this story is tragically heart-breakingThe moral: despite the fact that all these children get to make their final wish through the Genie Foundation they all have to come to terms with the fact that life isn't fair and the world isn't a wish-granting factoryThis is the kind of book you'll probably need a dictionary next to you while you read but it's 1000% worth it I recommend it so muchNot my favorite book of all time but one I'm so so glad I own This was a 4/5 book for meMen at some time are masters of their fates The fault dear Brutus is not in our stars but in ourselves that we are underlingsJulius CaesarAct I Scene II
Spoilers belowIn my favorite scene in this novel the narrator a sixteen year old cancer patient named Hazel reflects on why she did not want to kiss her love interest Augustus Waters  She can't make sense of it--he prepared an over-the-top Netherlands-themed picnic for her  He memorized a monologue in which he proposed a trip to Amsterdam to meet her favorite author  He is cute  She likes him  So why she wonders did she feel awkward when he touched her face  Why did she not want to kiss himIt was too much Hazel realizes  He was trying too hard  He was being Romantic instead of romanticIt is that scene that use of capitalization which pretty much sums up how I feel about John Green as a writerJohn Green is very very talented  I have always had a high regard for his work because he never talks down to his intended audience  His teenager characters are deeply complex and interesting  He introduces difficult topics about identity and one's place in the world about the meaning of heroism etc  He respects teenagers as intelligent individuals capable of great understanding and it's wonderful to readUnfortunately Green like his character Augustus Waters often goes too far  An example:  in one scene Hazel worries about the ghettoization of eggs  I fully believe that many teenagers have thought Hey why are eggs only served at breakfast  Why can't they be an any-time-of-the-day food  I just have serious doubts whether any of them have ever used the term ghettoization to describe that phenomenonThe argument could be made of course that using large unfamiliar words in such a context is an excellent learning opportunity for young readers  It challenges them pushes them to use a dictionary (or you know google) and expand their own vocabulary  I can't really argue with that  I will say though that it's the use of terms like that that make me see a bit of John Green in Augustus Waters  In his determination to challenge his readers he tries a bit too hard; it feels stilted rather than authenticRomantic rather than romanticI have always believed that John Green has it in him to write one of the great American novels; he writes with such a distinct voice with such compassion and humor  I've read all of his books and I have enjoyed each one but none of them has of yet lived up to what I believe is Green's potential  The characters are often pretentious bordering on unrealistic  It makes it difficult to relate to them; they are like the people I wish I were rather than the person I actually am  Furthermore huge grandiose events seem to always pop up right at the end of every novel taking you out of the reality of teenagers dealing with actual problems  Life not lifeI went into TFioS with low expectations and with a single capital R John Green won me over  Yes the issues I have with his writing remain--the teenagers are too eloquent too clever (for goodness sake how many sixteen year old girls have Prufrock memorized) and some plot points flirt with improbability  But for the first time I saw self-awareness in the funny yet implausible dialogueThis is the most growth I've seen in Green's writing and it's really great; I hope it continues  I want to see more of lower-case-r romantic John GreenThe Fault in our Stars is romantic funny sad and sweet  It is a good read and I would recommend it to everyone
I did not care for this book It did not have much of a story I was bored throughout the book
Too cheesy
It is okay
Excellent
Awesome 
It was ok
good read
Good read
Did not enjoy the writing
It is okay  It is written for young adults (teenagers) so I am probably not the best to write a review for this book I liked that the author depicted the teenagers as being respectful and intelligent  There were some scenes that just did not make since to me
The best
Awesome
Supreme
Did not like it at all
i didn't like this book
I was surprised at how much I liked this book  The characters were well-drawn and witty  Although I am not a cancer survivor my best friend died of cancer at a young age so this book was particularly sad for me  You might need some tissues
I was unexpectedly surprised by the depth of feeling experienced while reading this book At first I was not impressedhowever as I continued to read I became swept away with emotion This book is like life sadhappyfunnyand contemplative
Very very very sad heavy subject matter NOT for young readers
My teens heard this was a great book and asked me to get it for them  I read it and I think it is a truly stupid book  It has a bad moral lesson and although it could be a realistic experience it is certainly not one that I appreciated
Not original Too irreverent Sounds like the author is trying to be intellectual but the story falls flat with no new insight He misses life`s greatest gift during inevitable pain that being the hope of life after death through Jesus
Boring
love it
This was a wonderful book It was a really easy read and tackled a touch subject with humor and a plot that will appeal to both adults and young adults I recommend this book to everyone Just expect to cry at some point :)
not my type of book
This book was so stupid and disappointing All the references to literature authors unfinished books trip to Amsterdamall was nonsense Should have just stuck to a love story about 2 teens dying of cancer
Like many other reviewers I didn't particularly like this book I didn't see what Augustus would see in Hazel in the first place and their instantaneous love/attraction needed some build up I saw the ending coming a mile away and I found the dialogue to be over the top and pretentious The whole book lacked depth
thanks
Very depressing
Cancer is so sad The lives it touches and hurts But with our Lord Jesus Christ as our Savior this life is but a blink of an eye compared to our eternal life with the Lord
Review may have spoiler I didn't become very invested emotionally with the characters  Teens with Cancer - you'd think that would emotionally connect  Did not enjoy the swearing and the fact that it portrayed teens having sex  I saw so many great reviews of the book I expected to love it  Even my nieces enjoyed it  And in truth it wasn't a terrible book (as I did finish it)  I was thinking of doing it for a book club book but it just wasn't good enough for me  Just my preference
Great
Ok so it was good in the beginning But then he started using all these cuss words and I didn't like that at ALL If you are a follower in Jesus Christ DON'T READ THIS BOOK I am a follower and John Green was really making me mad with all this crap he was saying about God Lastly it was very inappropriate I'm 11 so I guess adults might disagree Final line don't read this book unless you like cuss words and lots of them
not impressed
I have no major complaints with this book  It just didn't grab my interest very well  Its based on a group of teenage cancer sufferers so you know they are going to die from the start its just a question of who will die first  There was also a love affair between two of them  So it was sad and I did shed a few tears despite my best efforts but I can't recommend it unless you are 13
The book was very good I gave it a one star because the kindle version of the book has many faults in it It is apparent that an editor did not review this book in the digital format words are misspelled punctuation is horrible and capitalization is incorrect in many places This is the digital age however many kindle books including this one are not up to par with printed books
this stupid book ruined my life i hate it so much all copies should be burned so our future children won't have to feel the pain i felt
Was obvious very early on that the Healthy boyfriend would pre-decease her  So was fairly transparent  Still a good read
First time reading John Green so I am not sure if this is his consistent writing style or specific to this book But I thought The Fault in Our Stars was like reading a 13 year old's diary The choice of vocabulary and dialogue overall sounded very immature and annoying Maybe it was to lighten the book's atmosphere because a book about teens with terminal cancer and death can be a really depressing book to read but I think in this case it works against the book
I would not have bought the book if I had known the subject matter Life is difficult enough I want to be entertained when I read
I am in my 30's but enjoy some young adult fiction (Hunger Games Harry Potter Scorpio Races) and this book got such amazing reviews that I had to check it out The entire time I was reading it all I could think was how in the world it got so many 5 star ratings This is a young adult book that is true to its target age audience and probably would not be enjoyed by most adults I had gotten another of Green's books from the library as well and ended up taking it back without reading it Don't get me wrong the writing is good and the character development is decent so I think those within his target age range would enjoy it but I would not recommend the book to the average adult
I am a 20something law student and wanted to check out the buzz on this young adult fiction best seller  I thought the writing was good enough to start and finish the entire book in one sitting so that's certainly saying something but still felt it was a little too ridiculous for my taste  The injection of an unlikable fictional author into a very heartwarming tale about terminal illness and young love was just too much  Silly really but I guess it's the kind of thing you'd expect from a young adult novel  Overall I'm glad I read The Fault in Our Stars (it even motivated my purchase for another John Green novel) even though I didn't really enjoy the overarching story line
While admittedly this is a sweet story it is completely inappropriate for children less than high school age  This was given as a gift to my 3rd grader with the comment that it was the top-rated book for pre-teens of 9-12 years old  I  casually flipped through the book as I generally preview books my younger children read not only to discern if the material is appropriate and the book well-written but to prepare myself for potential discussion with my child  In the first four random flips I found words like ba****d and page implying sexual activity  I recommend anyone considering this book for a child read it first to determine if it is something the child is mature enough for  It is definitely not for the age bracket recommended to me and I did not allow my 9 year old to read it  This story could have been told with equal honesty and sensitivity but without the irreverence and bad language
Two teenagers dying of cancer try to find undying love at the last minute before death Too little too late
I liked the story line  It was very interestingI did not like the vulgar language - the swear words
This book was terrible There was barely a story in the book There were 2 kids with cancer who went to Amsterdam Then one kid died The end It was a depressing book and as another reviewer said it was an EXTREMELY bad attempt at being meaningful If I could give it zero stars I would
This book was terrible because I just ended but the book itself was great but I HATE HATE HATE the ending
Wasn't able to open download once I bought it and had to return it I ended up getting the paper copy
Gahahahahahahahahahaha bags us USB have us Jabs UBS is d did d did hand Had a Heubs USB rev end
The book had bent pages It is unfortunate because this was supposed to be a gift for my cousin
Look I love this book but I hate that u had to kill Gus that broke me I don't know what to say
yay
hopeless
Pretenious but bland and 1 dimensional teenage characters cliched over use of the starcrossed lovers trope boring plot and not in the slightest bit upsetting when it endedIt's basically twilight but with the vampires replaced with cancerWorst ¬£8 I've ever spent in my life it's going to the charity shop in the morning
I just didn't like it Hazel was bitchy Augustus was an annoying smart ass who reminded me of Willy Wonka I hate the characters but I still support finding a cure for cancer
I truly enjoyed the majority of this book I would love to be able to recommend it to others But sadly I cannot The Fault in Our Stars is a touching and captivating story about young teenagers facing the harsh cruelties cancer The book is extremely popular with young teens which is why I struggle with it so much Had Mr Green 's target audience not been teens my opinion would be completely different But since it is I find it inexcusable to sabotage a great story with the  senseless chapter of the two teenage characters losing their virginity This event is actually a proud/triumphant/certainly not a what we're we thinking/we should not have done that/moment With the constant peer pressure our young kids face every day it sure would have been refreshing if Mr Green had taken the high road and not encouraged teen sex I personally am very disappointed in Mr Green and disappointed in this book Had the one chapter with the Venn diagram been left out it could be a great book for our young teens to enjoy Instead it's one more attempt to desensitize our kids to immoral and dangerous behavior that the media loves to do Shame on you Mr Green
Ok
Let me tell you a little story I got this book a while ago It was the first John Green book I'd read I read it in 3 days staying up late to finish it I cried over Augustus' death ( don't get mad at me for spoiling it we all saw it coming) and marveled over their profoundness As always i took a step back and analyzed what i REALLY thought about it Not what everyone thought  I think that its overrated It's not like i completely dislike it But i dont love it  One of my annoyances is the afore mentioned 'profoundness' No teenager canser surviver or not woul EVER talk like that They constantly say: i know we're gonna die someday but all you shallow normal people don't I have made an obsevation about life as we know it It's gonna be deep it's gonna knock your socks off so take note all you inferior non-canser people You die in the middle of life in the middle of a sentence bet you didn't think of that And Augustus' way of explaining basketball: One day i was playing basketball And i was thinking about the repetitive childlike stupidity of it its like a child playing with the shape toys So THATS why he quit Hazel questioning EGGS  Why are eggs only for breakfast Why can't you have them for lunch Okay 1) You CAN have eggs for lunch eg egg salad And 2) Out of all the things to ponder deeply about thats what you choose Now i get that none of these are direct quotes its just the way i interpret them  Uhm Gus you okay Someone should have asked him that He is constantly making an 'observation' that he pompously states in the most diplomatic manner; bordering on beyond ridiculous He has an unlit cigeret in his mouth All the time And he does this to prove what exactly That he can control his death Uh sorry buddy it doesn't work that way He thinks he's so deep and witty and he doesn't try to hide it He was so pretentious and condescending that i grew frustrated at him a lot  Hazel you do know that by some mirical you are alive today right She is such a debby downer when it comes to anything At her support group she feels the need to rain on everybody around her by saying  You know that one day there's not going to be anybody to rember you or me There was a time before humans and there is a time after We're hurtling towards an oblivian that is the fact that we are all going to die You can choose to ignore it God knows everyone else does Wow thanks Hazel the fact that im not immortal is completely new to me I had no idea i was going to die You have opened my eyes to a whole new world ( Did you catch the sarcasm) But did she seriously think that in a room full of kids with canser we didn't know that death was a possibilty It's a side effect of dying Are you not AT ALL thankful that even at deaths door you recovered and are alive with parents that love you I guess not  Now don't even try to pull the no sympathy card with me I felt so bad for them with canser and all I'm just saying that she really should be thankful that she didn't die when she could have  On another note I have a thing or two to say about this Amsterdam trip Peter van Houten Woah there Peter how has your assistant not put you in rehab When Hazel and Agustus visit it had me question the reasoning Why if it was a complete failier did Green even write this whole part of the book I think Van Houten was just a pawn to keep the plot going in the middle and the end  What i did like was that Green has an exceptional ability to write I have tried to read Looking for Alaska but it was to inappropiat With that aside his writing has a poetic-ish yet blas√® way of saying things If his characters weren't so annoying i would have enjoyed this more
I had high expectations for this book and was very disappointed when this book did not fulfill those expectations I felt that this being a best seller and with the reviews I read that this book would be more interesting than what it was I thought the book would be a really sad book which would make me cry but no it just made me mad about how much I disliked it This book contained the dumbest love story where two I'll characters hang out as friends but then they fall in love with one kiss when in reality they don't really know each other that well or anything but even though I hate itthat is basically the best part in the book because then the main character dies right after that and then the book ends and you're just faced whether to like the book with the rest of society just because or you can face reality and say it was a terrible book like it actually was
This has a good storyline but the language was not ok This book is not for children Because of the language I stopped reading it
Hardcover was flattened in the corner
I thhought it was a weird bood  The only part I enjoyed was the middle of the book
Nicely developed characters but depressing Green dwells on the depression
It reads like it was written by a 13 year who think he's special because he reads and drinks tea The characters were insufferable as was the dialogue The 'twist' was schlocky and contrived Do not recommend
This book felt like an adult trying to be a teenager (gratuitous sarcasm and profanity) Although poignant in parts especially near the end it just didn't seem genuine (can't quite find the right word) In the end I just didn't buy it I never felt connected to the characters  Yes I dabbed a tear or two but if I can't get emotionally invested until the last chapter
Popwatch is running a contest to determine the best YA novel of all time 60 novels were chosen for the honor and after a week of voting it's come down to just two: the Harry Potter series by JK Rowling and The Fault in Our Stars by John GreenI assume everyone reading this is familiar with Harry Potter but as for TFiOS and John Green here's a bit of context: John is a part time Youtube celebrity/part time author who has built himself a fiercely loyal fanbase that call themselves `nerdfighters' They purport to be people who stick up for the little guy and advertise themselves as people who celebrate and defend all things nerdy It was through their passion and devotion that TFiOS could end up finishing no worse than runner-up when all is said and doneI was only passingly familiar with John Green until recently I had heard of his work and many of my friends were devoted readers of his but I never had an interest in reading any of his work until TFiOS became as big as it is now While I'm not a huge a fan of the YA genre I eventually sat down to read it The plot is basically as follows: 17 year old Hazel Lancaster has cancer and attends a support group for said cancer She is enchanted by the author of An Imperial Affliction who has written her favorite book about cancer At support group she meets a boy named Augustus Waters whom she becomes smitten with instantly They fall in love and together attempt to find the author of An Imperial Affliction while dealing with cancer each other and the trials and tribulations of being a teenagerThe biggest and most noticeable problem is the dialogue To put it simply it's laughable:It does not taste like God Himself cooked heaven into a series of five dishes which were then served to you accompanied by several luminous balls of fermented bubbly plasma while actual and literal flower petals floated down around your canal-side dinner tableHow did scrambled eggs get stuck with breakfast exclusivityThese are teenagers You can tell me they talk like this because they had to grow up faster (as if that's an excuse) until you're blue in the face and I won't buy it Not with lines like this:There will come a time when all of us are dead All of us There will come a time when there are no human beings remaining to remember that anyone ever existed or that our species ever did anything There will be no one left to remember Aristotle or Cleopatra let alone you Everything that we did and built and wrote and thought and discovered will be forgotten and all of this will have been for naught Maybe that time is coming soon and maybe it is millions of years away but even if we survive the collapse of our sun we will not survive forever There was time before organisms experienced consciousness and there will be time after And if the inevitability of human oblivion worries you I encourage you to ignore it God knows that's what everyone else doesThe whole book is like this I'll never fault a writer for writing in his natural voice (if that's truly how he speaks) but this is a perfect example of a style that is incompatible with the genre When you claim to be true to how teenagers think feel and talk and come up with a contrived and pretentious mess it makes me question how in tune to teenage culture and reality you are Funnily enough if this contest was any indication Green is being touted as the poster child for a writer that gets teenagers If that's true teenagers have an awfully generous view of themselves I don't know a single person adult or teen that talks like that and I'm a teenager myselfBut I guess I can't blame him He panders to his demographic brilliantly I can only imagine how many young girls read this and wish for their own Augustus Waters It's base wish fulfillment and he does it well It reminds me of another book that's been accused of being wish fulfillment -  Twilight Both require a shotgun romance in order to work There is no rhyme reason or motivation - the characters get together because the plot demands it Both have a plot that's subservient to the romance Both introduce a perfect man into the lives of their teenage girl protagonists More importantly both books have `projection characters' - characters with no real personality or motivation - as main characters so that readers can project themselves into the story in their placeCharacterization is creating complex relatable characters that have real motivations desires and faults; in other words it's making characters that are human It's making us care about what happens to these characters When you make them so shallow we have to substitute ourselves into the story you're avoiding accountablility to your readers because you're no longer telling a story about characters You're telling a story about the reader and who doesn't have an emotional reaction to themselvesWhat personality does Hazel have She likes watching TV she bitches about support group and she's into having public sex in the Anne Frank house (a thing that actually happens to cheering and applause I'm not even s***ting you At this point the story becomes so ridiculous it doesn't even merit a serious response) She also coincidentally likes to Capitalize Things like This I counted nearly 100 (yes one hundred) incidents of this It's quirky and quirky sells I guess but it's more conveniently a way to disguise immature and underdeveloped writingHazel's only role in the story is to provide an outlet for Augustus to wax poetic To put it bluntly Augustus is the pseudo-intellectual mouthpiece of John Green I've never seen a more annoying self-satisfied character in my life He talks about the philosophy and justification for running hurdles He quotes poetry and he's oh so gorgeous What's striking though is how similar he is to John Green in his mannerisms beliefs and how he presents himselfThis is not good character writing It's narcissistic and self indulgent I don't care if John Green is the most charitable giving person on Earth self inserting yourself as the philosophical hero of your own story is the height of arrogance That isn't the only incident of narcissism; Hazel is obsessed with an author who wrote a book about cancerjust like John Green The parents are an idealistic version of his own parenting style Every character in some way shape or form is a manifestation of his personality Because YA as a genre is almost exclusively character driven when your characters are shallow unlikable and you don't know how to write them any other way your story is doomedThe biggest problems however are the liberties John Green takes to make the story work He has said that he ignores the facts of cancer with a grin in order for the story to read like he wants it to He has also said that he believes teenagers are smarter than they're given credit for and that the book was an attempt to capture their true thought process I agree but there's a problem: you can't ignore the facts of cancer with a grin You can't possibly say you're trying to write the realistic thought process of teenagers then ignore the reality of what they're going through It's dishonest and insincereHow does he do that A combination of poor characterization ham-fisted dialogue and a sloppy plotline dependent on the shallow romance of its protagonists But it's not just bad writing It's a lot more than that and the underlying reason why this book made me so angryWhen I was younger my uncle was diagnosed with throat cancer He took it as seriously as an inmate would take a judge's death sentence He survived and is now thriving but he took it seriously because cancer demands respect We've had remarkable medical advances that have made it not quite the death sentence it once was but it's still the deadliest thing in existence So when you have cancer you are understandably afraid for your life That leads me to this:[]He died weeks later This is how a brave man reacts to his own mortality This is also the same attitude that is mocked openly shamelessly and repeatedly throughout the book Cancer isn't a joke People die from it and they're afraid of it They're afraid for their lives and from the time they're diagnosed to the time it's in remission or they're dead they are being affected by it be it from the chemo keeping them bed-ridden or from them being so weak from treatment that they don't have the energy to see other people They don't quote poetry at each other They don't opine lovingly about the nature of existence Cancer is not a game John Green It's not something you exploit for your own masturbatory fantasiesFunnily enough while he insists teenagers are smarter than they're given credit for he insists on explaining the metaphors and philosophical meaning within the book as if they aren't that smart at all It's not even done well The best example of this Augustus placing a cigarette in his lips and refusing to light it He says this is an example of doing something deadly but not giving it the power to kill you It's treated as this great philosophical insight and the story sets this up so that we're supposed to revel in his brillianceI've heard similar criticisms levied at his other works so I don't think it's just a one time bad book thing This completely put me off his other books Maybe that's a good thing I end by saying that the primary problem with TFiOS John Green Nerdfighters and everyone in between is an inability to grow up I ask John Green to speak for himself because the fault is in your stars not ours
Did not re is e a book
This book was predictable from Chapter One and basically nothing really happens I was annoyed that the life-changing favorite book of Hazel's was a made up book by John Green and was repetitively described as what John Green likely hoped his would beAll the characters were unlikable because they were so pretentious and overly-quirky Every kid felt the same person with same voice vocabulary and wit The book was soaked in pop-foax-philosophy which made the whole thing feel like it was trying way too hard50% of the book had nothing to do with the plot and just made me hate the characters more I know the 20 pages dedicated to describing Amsterdam and the Anne Frank house were probably just added because of the grant John Green received to write in Amsterdam for two months they added nothing to the storyAll in all I felt like Hazel was an instrument for John Green to blow his own horn and Gus was a badly developed character who annoyed me from beginning to end His only role was to aggressively reenforce how original and smart Hazel is I did not understand what was SO special about Hazel She could do no wrong in this book She even gives some superior insight to her own genius hero author who evidently was just missing her deeply honest and intelligent observations on the universeThe ending was anti climactic and when I think about where I would suggest you stop reading because nothing else happens afterward I think you can stop after Chapter One I thought Chapter One was good
Bored Bored Bored
This book read like a bad Lifetime movie I only finished it because it was our book club's pick of the month
Despite rave reviews and the educational value this novel was not for us  Minor language problems and occasional sexual comments became enough that we put it down and haven't picked it back up  Swearing and teens having sex (which we learned was included) is not our idea of a good read  The fact that the two teens made love did not even make sense with her over-protective mother constantly looking over her shoulder  This does give a great understanding of what it is like to live with visible disabilities but at too great a cost
You  waste of time no connection Don't know why this is so popular right now Find a dif read plz
el is a 16 year old with cancer with stage IV cancer Her lungs are shot and she is on oxygen continuosly Her favorite book An Imperial Affliction is the story of a teen with cancer and her relationship with her family The ending of this book just leaves off abruptly and leaves Hazel needing to find out the ending Hazel meets Augustus at her suppport group meeting also battling cancer To Hazel his is all Man Augustus gives up his Make a Wish to take Hazel to Amsterdam to meet the looney alcholic author of this book This book was given to me to read by a co-worker I found it very unbelievable and zanny To begin with I thought it made a mochary of cancer and survivors The dialogue the charactors had was so over anyone's head This is not how real teens speak to one another You needed a dictionary to follow along The whole story left me bewildered and wondering what the author was trying to get across
I'm a guy it made me cry a littleThis is a fantastic book for young adults still learning an ok it life and where there thought process is still progressing This book will make you think about everythingit is not just a book about cancer patients It's a book about everyone's life and how you can make a difference no matter who you are I believe this book can change many lives Even though these characters are fictional green does a fantastic job making them seem real I suggest this book to everyone for this is a fantastic book and should be read by everyone I thank John Green for writing this book it will change the lives of many for the better I hope be continues to write for writing and reading may be the answer to life So this book deserves 5 stars even though none will read my comment I hope me putting this out there will help others read this book as wellDJ Feehery
Hazel is terminally ill with cancer That her life will be short is known What may be unknown to the reader is how cancer changes the life she has left How do we treat a child with cancer What happens to their friendships when they can no longer attend school And what possibilities are there for love This is the interesting part of The Fault in Our Stars What I found hard to believe was the extremely witty intelligent older-than-their-years banter of these 16-year olds It was funny and crackling but didn't ring trueLisa ArdAuthor of Saving Halloween and the Dream Seeker series
Amazing book
I ordered for my daughter  For some reason she thought this was a signed copy but it is not  I guess the customer images on the product page are misleading  although disappointed this copy is not signed by the author she still enjoyed the book  Super fast delivery for standard shipping - arrived with in 2 days of order
I hated the book  It was both abstract and incomplete  Only because I rarely stop reading a book did I finish it
You can see Green trying toske money from a movie from page 1 That's the saddest thing about this book
While the intense subject matter held promise for a moving story it was a huge let down  Just skip it
in the worst way possible I was wary of buying a book about a terminally ill teen falling in love because it's so easy to fall in the the sentimental Walk to Remember trap But I bought the book because several of my guy friends told me they couldn't believe how clever and funny it was One of my friends even confessed it made him weep and affected his view on lifeWhat a mistake There were several times as I was reading on the subway that I had to slam the book shut and mutter This is so unrealistic This is so idiotic Everyone in the book speaks like over-pretentious Diablo Cody characters living in the melodramatic world of Nicholas Sparks I could go into more detail about what I didn't like but I feel other reviewers have already said it just as well I suppose the book's worst crime is making the characters so smart and witty that they don't seem likable or for that matter human Also: the fact that half the content of this book is summarizing the plot of books or movies like V for Vendetta The readers don't need summaries of stories by other authors--we just need one really good story from the author at hand Felt like reading a book report at timesAlthough the first few pages held promise I hated the book by the end of the first chapter I'm sorry to trash John Green but this is the first time I've ever felt the need to publicize how much I disliked an overrated book
this was a very good read and made one think It was very anti-Christianwhich was why i did not give it more stars
I think this book is only getting good reviews because it's about cancer patients Though it's a touching story and had a few very good points and ideas the dialogue and characters were terribleNothing that happened was very realistic I don't care how many cancer perks someone has a flight attendant will not let underage kids drink on an airplane America's airway is insanely strictJohn Green was trying to make every person in the book a philosopher At least one person will say almost-touching things to the main character every other page I felt as though the dialogue was so similar between characters everyone was the same person There was no personality no depth I no longer cared about anyone by the time the story was overOne other little thing that bothered me was her parents were terrible to her and wouldn't let her do anything even though she was dying Maybe they just wanted to keep her caged up for the rest of her existence I don't know-but she still treated them like they were God's gift to Earth
Worst book ever I have never cried so much Just save your tears and don't read the fault in our stars
I couldnt make it through two chapters The teens didnt speak like teens Hazel's character didnt speak or think like a girl way too glib for real cancer patients  Honestly it was so unbelievable I couldnt tell how it became a  NY times bestseller  Just that fact soils the honor  and whoever edited the book was asleep I have read many books written for the YA or youth audience but none of them this poorly written Dialogue is an art but you must know your characters If you write from the outside no one on the inside will believe you
This book is so very inspiring It shows the world that death isn't all that bad It has good reason and God chooses that reason It also shows a amazing love story of Hazel and Gus It is very sad at some points but it brings back the humour and love to the story It has a very sad ending but the perfect ending for this book I have heard a lot of mixed feelings for this book some people say they will not read it because they don't want to cry their hearts out over a book but others who will read it have all said (I think for the most part) have loved it My review that I give will have to start by saying wow the choice of words and quotes is quite amazing but the story it self is a fantastic love story that I believe everyone should at least read some of the book But it's not like anyone will ever read this long paragraph that took forever to type so for now I guess I will stop here even though this only half of what I would like to say
This book is the worst I have no idea why it's popular
I WANT to like John Green  I do  But after An Abundance of Katherines and now The Fault in Our Stars I'm giving up  The couple's romance was not compelling  The philosophy crammed down the reader's throat was annoying  Disappointment all around
Boring Boring Boring  Yes it's sad After the first half of the book I realized it was a wasteful readCharacter development is great but that's it  Plot  Story arcLook elsewhere for a good read
I read this book at the request of a friend saying this was a great read  I found it depressing and childish at times and was highly disappointed that the guy the two children idolized was a two bit drunk  Highly disappointed
I could not get past the first couple of pages  This book may or may not have a good story line but I could not get past the fowl language  It amazes me they require kids to read this stuff but then when they use the same language in school they get in trouble for it  Call me old fashion but I think a book can still be really good with out all the curse words  Just my opinion
So in th begining of the book it was good but boringyou always thought that something good was going to happen and then it doesn't  Something always gets in the way In the end it gets even more boring it's like the book never stops it keeps on dragging hope youtk my review into consideration sorry author :( :( :( :( :(
Too sad
Hated it
The book is great BUT when I received the book it had a booger on the front of the book and on the back of the book it was all sticky with black hairs stuck to the sticky mess It was rather disgusting
When i picked up this book from the bookstore I couldn't stop reading the first few pages so I decided to buy it on Amazon because the price was much better This book is different in a way but also similar in many aspects I enjoyed the first few chapters of the book since I thought it was very different An ill girl with an ill guy falling in love Very interesting story until towards the end of the story it goes by very quicklyI was okay with the ending but the build up towards the end was poor for me I was expecting more from it Not going to lie the story is like any other romance novels with cancer patients It's very typical I personally think I wasted my money on this book If i could I would return it if they would give me full price but that's not possibleI wouldn't recommend this book Read it in a day and I know i wasted my timeI understand my comment is not very elaborate but hopefully few people agree with me
I read two chapters and had to stopIt's not that it isn't well written; the subject matter is just too hard for me to read
I'm sure this is a great book although I have been unable to read it Because it keeps skipping pages and repeating itself I believe there is something wrong with it I'm using a kindle fire HD Does anyone know how I can contact Amazon about this problem
I got the book because of the hype When you search for #book on instagram you will see that TFIOS is a current trend 2 out of 10 pictures are of this book so I got it from the bookstore where I workI finished it this morning &amp; thought to myself This is it This is what people are crazy about The book is fairly poorly written Not deep or interesting enough to sustain me to engage in it Disappointed as I finished the last pageMoreover it did not seem to me that the book really ended Poor ending I would say
I just read the first 39 pages of this book and I probably should not be reviewing it The opening was catchy but relationship and conversations between Hazel and Gus are unbelievable I am a teacher and most teens are not this witty I am going to give it a chance and finish the book but I am somewhat sickened that the two main characters have such similar personalities Perhaps I don't know enough about this JOHN GREEN NERD STUFF but these kids sound like authors who put deep hours of thought into everything they say but it just flies out of their mouths
As a real-life stage 4 cancer kid I am ashamed of people like John Green who exploit us to make a few bucks  Lets see what percentage of the proceeds he donates to a children's cancer charity and how much he spends on a bigger house  I'm sure that movie deal is looking rather lucrative
Okay I decided to read this because well of all the great reviews I failed to take the time to also read the negative reviews Needless to say I regret not reading the negative ones In two words this book is pretentious and unrealistic I read to the end to see if anything was truly redeeming there was not a point in which I thought so By the end hoping that it would jerk some emotion in me it failed to do so I've never been so dissapointed by a book in my entire life By the time I finished the first word that popped in my head was pretentious This is the worst book I've ever read and I do not recommend it at all
This book was a huge letdown for me and didn't deserve all the hype it got It was written like a rough draft and the plot to me was so unrealistic and two dimensional Just skip over this book and read something better I expected more from Green
To read about the nonbelievers in God was hopeless and sad Faith is everything and He is most certainly real
This book was terrible The entire plot was predictable I knew how it was going to end by the end of the first chapter This was a cheap shot at exploiting terminal illnesses and trashy romance
The characters were too strange and unrealistic The plot was so bland With all the hype the book has received I expected something thought provoking but it never was Green took such a simple sad topic to easily affect his reader's emotions but even so I never felt any sadness the whole way through The characters were so bland yet bizarre that I never cared about them I finished the book in hopes of some big opinion altering moment that never came Wouldn't suggest this to anyone
Very disappointing A complete waste of my time I kept reading thinking it was gonna get better but it didn't
I would love to have read this but it NEVER GOT IT~
I am a nerdfighter I enjoy the videos and the brothers however I simply can't get into this book  It is boring and I find myself not caring about the characters  I was really looking forward to reading this book It has been on my to read list for several months  I even considered buying it but now I'm glad I didn't  I am so very disappointed by this book  I stopped reading in order to save myself from destroying the image I have of them  Let's just act like this never happened
I bought this book because of it's incredible feedback and was so excited to read it  Then I finished and thoughtokay and what was so great  All the book consists of is cheesy pick up lines and overly sarcastic dialogue  The characters are annoying the story feels forced  Never once did I shed a tear  The thing is I've never read a John Green book but I knew a lot about him and his career and this book just seems to not be playing toward his strengths  It just isn't believable and seems very Hollywood which is something I didn't expect from Green  For such a good writer I expected something more moving and powerful It is a book about cancer and yet I never felt sorry for either character  It is a cheesy teenage love story and all their love consists of is them saying okay to each otherand that's it Each one had a glass half-empty look on life and I just didn't care  I will never know why people enjoy the book so much
The book is just twilight with cancer kids I don't understand why people like this the characters are incredibly snarky they seem  way to smart to be teenagers(yes i could tell this was being written by a man in his mid-30s) and I could not feel sorry for them Mainly cause pulling the cancer card is cheep trick that authors use to generate sympathy for characters we would otherwise despise and I saw right through that vail Worst of all John Green is a good writer usually( I read an abundance of Katherines and Paper Towns and loved them) but this book is his worst to date Are all these reviews being written by little girls I was very disappointed And yes I am boycotting the movie when it comes out
I can not imagine somebody giving this POS a good review when all I typed in was a search for a watch How can advertising take so much toll on a company toobecome a tool itself
I cried like four times And I am going to keep reading this book over and over like sad books I highly recommend this book:
I hated both of the characters to the point of wanting them to die I wish John Green didn't make books just for 13 year old girls Boring too
I thought it was boring up until the end No one falls in love with someone in like a chapter
The Fault in Our Stars currently has almost overwhelmingly positive response pretty much everyone I know has given it 5 stars thus I'm certain no one would want to read my sour musings except me and maybe a couple of other like-minded and unimpressedWhat I'd love to know is this - what makes a writer to undertake the topic of cancer So much has already been written about it so many Lifetime movies filmed so many tears shed It literally has been done to death What new did John Green have to bring to the cancer tableThe way I see it nothing Having your terminally sick characters be ironic about their illnesses and swap cancer jokes isn't groundbreakingThe Fault in Our Stars isn't a bad book but it's a standard cancer book and sadly a standard John Green book with standard John Green humor and standard John Green charactersYou have a witty and intelligent protagonist (this time 2 Hazel and Augustus - a female and male versions of Miles/Quentin/Colin) a funny slightly pathetic sidekick (Isaac - another version of Hassan/Chip/Marcus) a mysterious unhinged girl Gus's dead ex (Alaska/Margo clone) and of course the signature ROAD TRIP I can't help but recognize these people and this plot I've read all of Green's novelsI understand why so many readers would have such an emotional response to the book Nothing will get the ladies crying quicker than a kid dying of cancer Add in some long farewells painkillers eulogies and funerals - you can collect buckets of tears But IMO here Green aims for the most obvious the most easily accessible emotions for the most typical life lessonsFrankly I think The Fault in Our Stars is Green's weakest work to date weaker even than half-baked Zombicorns Because this unlike his earlier works feels commercial and intentionally tearjerky and insincere It will probably sell the most copies
This book is complete drivel  Do not waste your time or money on this
Let me start off by saying there was a moment of serious deliberation in my part choosing the accurate amount of stars I was transfixed on 25 stars but there's no such thing I think 2 Stars too readily condemns this book I think 3 stars gives it too much of a positive-thumbs-up image I will write briefly why I I consider it 3 stars Also I want to emphasize I guess I'm feeling a little modesty in giving him 3 stars Okay Here we go My taking on John Green's bookJohn Green's most popular book up to date as can easily be seen is The Fault in Our StarsI will admittedly state right now I have not perused the book wholeheartedly to bring into question the verisimilitude in its Romance and philosophy - the latter which has produced some debate I will focus on this brief review more on the author than the actual book for personal reasons I feel people ought to know before buying the bookJohn Green if you watch the Amazon video clip by the author admits to his fans it took him a process of 10 years or at least that's when the actual idea of TFIOS originated Nevertheless let it stand as evidence he produced much thought on this book Which I do not know if this would be true concerning his other books I'm merely guessing here when I say this is the first time he has ever hit #1 on the seller's list in Amazoncom Thus these are a few points I want to make about himI have not inspected the book thoroughly in search of its good literary qualities Because in fact after giving it a once over it becomes clear his audience -in majority- are teenagers The way love is treated in TFIOS is a basic love story in strangers - Once you remove the age group Someone meets someone else in a mental therapy place Emotions are believable and expounded rightly by the author But a reviewer here (on Amazoncom) deemed and made a good point that the structure of the book is very similar to other books including Fight Club Which all are good and fun movies mind you But is their influence a good one I ask I'm digressing here a little The point is Green does not appeal to me because I feel this love story has been said and done before honestly I do feel that way yesGreen is but trying to become a writer in the literary world by the manipulation of his ignorant teenage fans who do not question profoundly enough He says it himself here sugarcoated of course When asked how does he feel on his new found success Green answersWhat it tells me is that I'm a lucky guy But it also says that if you are authentic with your readers they will trust you when you come out with a new storyYes He has the trust of his readers namely the NerdFighters WTF is a Nerdfighter in the first place Let me guess defending the misconceptions of nerds as being weak Ha I am just going to be elated if that's its meaningAnyway That's all I have to say about his fictional literary prowess Summarized briefly I dislike the book I think it's quite overrated by his fans helping promote and acting as advertisements on Amazoncom -which has so many high reviewsNow on to the nonfiction aspects of the book I do not know enough about categorization to know if this book falls under Post Modernist but if it does it's rather a bland one and no where near the level of contemporary Post-Modern writersLike I mentioned before this books delves - No Actually I'm pretty confident to say - it DABBLES in philosophical thought Not enough for the average teen to contrast the verisimilitude in philosophical thought in the book's reoccurring themes of existentialism Which I find not up to par when you actually analyze Existentialism and the Existentialism in TFIOS Which leaves you with the Existentialism in our Youth Admirable little subject-matter for Green to take up but he fails almost whole-hardheartedly if he thinks his book is in the league of a new genreTo summarize his fiction writing and nonfiction writing I find underdeveloped - Oversimplified almost But I do commend his attemptsAnyone who thinks a higher rating than 3 Stars is applicable to this book seriously needs perusing of it more I haven't because I know what lies therein with a quick once over of the book And reading Green's interviews and such I did not allow myself to be utterly invested emotionally Although I did give Green my imagination as I do with all fiction writers Hence he disappointed me when I learned the argument that he plagiarizes structures from other booksIn conclusion My rating is a 25 I was feeling modest so I gave him a 3Your welcome John Green and all you NerdFighters out there
I can't begin to say how much I disliked this book I finally stopped trying to get through it about half way through I thought it was going to be a coming of age story of these friends that have met in a youth cancer support group But it was more of a crap youth romance book Very cheesy and the characters are not believable or likable Like the boy love interest likes to walk around with a cigarette in his mouth but wont light it as a way to show the cigarette company they have no power over him BARF I mean they talk about that several times like he is sooo deep and pensive This book has gotten soooo many great reviews but this just was bad writing and a story that could have been really good but falls way short
This could have been an amazing and sad book Unfortunately it was poorly written so by the end of the book I was glad he finally shut up
Even though this is a very well written novel that at points gets hard to put down it was too depressing Now if you want to lose any value you find in life read this book The cynical outlook on it all is great for that but on the off chance you like life and don't want to spend 3-4 chapters bawling your eyes out and then have it just end then I don't suggest reading it There were points in this book where I had to take a break from reading it it got so depressing How they refer to themselves as side effects of life and not like real people also I just seriously hated that everything went wrong for this girl like come on finding out your cancer is just getting worse getting your dreams crushed by your favorite author wasting your boyfriends wish to then find out your boyfriend you just told you loved is going to die it just seems like a stretch to make the character as sympathy grabbing as can be I'm not going to lie I loved this book I also hated it once it was over it left me sad and full of other questions they never answered and in general unfulfilled 
These two kids instead of trying to get laid should have done more productive things instead Charity or something In our degenerate culture two kids who are going to die making love with each other is something to celebrate What happened if that girl with cancer got pregnant Also this book is stupid and predictableYou can learn nothing from this The only people who like this junk are females Females just read the most brain-numbing books because all they like is sex and love For the thinking man--myself--their is nothing that I can learn I hate this book
I read this book because all of my friends really enjoyed it but I thought it was really boring and highly overrated Augustus and Hazel are very annoying and aren't realistic teenagers at all I found that I couldn't really relate to them at all Also I'm a teenage girl therefore I do enjoy books that can make me cry I read lots of reviews saying how touching the book was but tbh I didnt even cry once and no one my age or any other age speak like the way those characters  do always saying boring metaphors which was probably the author's failed attempt at humor I also felt that the plot was a bit too predictable because I just knew that either Augustus or Hazel would die I stopped reading about halfway through because it bored me to tears and made me want to sleep I don't get why anyone would like reading this book
Went in expecting this amazing love story that triumphed through sickness and loss and it fell flat for me  I was hoping to laugh and cry like all the reviews I had read but finished the book by doing neither  Usually I prefer the book to the movie however on this one I have a feeling the movie will be able to draw me in more than the writing did  That is if I pay to even go see it
not a very good book :\ kinda cheesy and weird and it cussed too much my opinion may just be because I'm 13 but I don't know many people who like to read something inappropriate or BAD for every page or so I can see how some people would like the story and storyline but I am not one of those people
This is crass completely unrealisticchildish  immature I can't believe the positive reviews I briefly read through other one star reviews of this crass lacking inhumanity excuse fro a bookI didn't expect it to be any good but I didn't expect it to be so atrocious either
Literary hounds will dig this bookTeenage girls will adore this bookEveryone else will deem it over-emotional rubbishThe characters are not realistic and/or are underdevelopedIt's pretentious but it's (trying to be) literary; so that's to be expectedIt felt like a failed Nicholas Spark's 'scriptI'd like to see what Green can do when he grows up
I'm sure I'll upset some people who rave about this book and I really wanted to like it after all the wonderful things I heard  Fact is I thought it was terribleA lot of people seem to have had issues with the way Hazel and Augustus spoke to which I certainly agree- NO teenager speaks like that  BUT let's just say that there are some out that that do (I certainly don't want to assume if there are a small handful of teens that speak like this) It wasn't the dialogue of the character's so much that annoyed me it was the characters themselves  They were completely underdeveloped and sadly I could care less about what happened to them  I HATE reading books with underdeveloped characters and that's exactly what this book is  It's very badly written and I'm shocked that it's gotten such rave reviewsSorry but it's the truth
I feel heartless even saying it but luckily it is fiction This is a boring story of two teens that find love due to the common thread of cancer The climax is almost impossible to find and the ending doesn't match the conflict This one was a snore fest
I felt the book was well written  Loved the poetry and thought provoking ideas about life and death  I'm 64 and enjoyed the perspective of young people  Will never again say He will live in our hearts forever  Worth reading
I had a personal experience with a teenager who had cancer  The story made me sad and brought back sad memories I would never recommend the story to anyone who has a child who is going through cancer treatments
I loved the true beautiful humanity in the bookall the emotions and humor it left me crying and smiling at the same time
Wow to think he writes for young adults So very sad if you want to experience pure sadness Then start reading
with this 5th novel john green's sheep in wolf's clothing formula is set in stone his relatable surface level irreverence and sarcasm is always followed up with some detached PSA type message that contradicts his antisocial character his characters have that Dariaesque disaffection but they ultimately want to please their elders and respect their conservative values which is just BS if you want to write an angsty character follow through with it in a realistic way instead of taking these patronizing sharp turns into look kids you can be a rebel and respect your elders too *thumbs up* messages if you want to have the character re-evaluate their outlook give them a realistic reason for it he doesn't do any of that and anytime his writing seems like it's headed in an interesting original direction he derails it with a don't try this at home disclaimer i'm consistently disappointed by john green's playing both sides of the fence and lack of balls to follow through on what he starts
I haven't read such a boring book in a long time Unrealistic shallow and thankfully I didn't buy it Get it from your library and save your money
Oh my gosh when I finished this book I COULDN'T stop crying The emotional content John Green puts in to this is overwhelming I wish I could meet him in person like if he just flew to MA and I would ask him the same types of questions that Hazel asks Van Houten Then I would hug him and have him sign my book Thank you John Green for the best book of 2014
I heard that this was a great book I did not like anything about it I would not recommend this to anyone especially kids
Very good heartwarming storyabout two people truly caring and loving each other Very hard to put the book down until you were finished
Awesome story great emotion and real life relationships A great read for all ages Ps have a box of tissues handy
I love John Green I love his books and I think that they're fantastic Except for this oneThis book is very well done in terms of the writing It is well written no doubt but the story itself is lacking While the eulogies are beautiful they are not tear inducing because the characters themselves are not tear inducing I am a huge book and movie crier and yet I didn't shed a single tear What was really wrong with the characters was that it was from the point of view of a girl John Green is not a girl He encounters the same problem that Khaled Hosseini had in A Thousand Splendid Suns He doesn't understand the female psyche and thus the actions and emotions of Hazel are slightly ludicrous Ladies if you yourself were dying would you really say no to super hot Augustus Waters because of how his past girlfriend died No You wouldn't Would you suddenly be like No I don't actually feel any attraction to you and then suddenly go to Amsterdam and mack in various locations No You wouldn't Would you feel comfortable with anyone including an attractive guy staring at you No You wouldn'tAnd what bothers me most is the ending For one he just completely rips off himself and how he ended Looking for Alaska Both were essays of sorts about death That was obnoxious For two be honest with yourselves Would you really be okay with your parents suddenly being blas√© about your death Yes you would probably want them to move on But having your parents just be enthusiastic about their lives after your death is just painful to think about And at that no parents would be blas√© about the death of a child If your parents would then call the child protective services Right now Stop reading this and get to the phoneIf you want a book about cancer that is much more accurate a depiction of a female's emotions read Sort of Forever by Sally Warner It was written long before and has a few of the same themes I highly recommend itAnd Nerdfighters don't get huffy about the fact that I don't find this book to be a particular work of genius Think about what I said
I would have given this 0 stars if I could since I ordered the book probably two months ago It says I was supposed to receive it by  no later than April 9th and it's now almost May and I still don't have it This is the first time something like this has ever happened The thing I'm most upset about is that I paid whoever this is 10$ for absolutely nothing
This book was recommended by a good reading friend I read the whole book but halfway through I almost abandoned it I was hoping for an awesome ending to the story since it was so highly recommended but I was sorely disappointed
I tried reading this book and I found it boring I feel bad saying that because the story line could have been a lot better I ordered it because of the rave reviewssorry I just don't get all the 4 and 5 stars
I was very disappointed about this book after the reviews it got It was written for a teenager audience It is written very sappy and melodramatically The plot is boring and the book dragged on I had to force myself to finish it I would not recommend this book to anyone I know
First let me say that I NEVER EVER skip to the endI disliked this book so much that I did I found this to be boring and unrealistic of teenagers I won't say too much because I don't want to ruin it for others But I honestly couldn't care less about what happened to these kids Dont waste your time if you find you don't like itit doesn't get any better so don't keep reading hoping it will Blah what a waste
Plain and simple it was an irritating book My friends and I that all read it found it to be a waste of time
I haven't read it yet  Sorry
Very thought provoking  Details are amazing and makes small things important  Gives us all impetus to reflect on our footprint on other's lives no matter how unimportant we are in the big world picture  Great read
She (grandchild) read 3 pages and quit She reads 7 books a week and to give up after 3 pages says a lot about her interest in this book
I've read Will Grayson Will Grason and didn't mind it  However The Fault in Our Stars was like Jodi Picault for children  Insipid and emotionally manipulative  I read it and so did my teenage daughter aged 14 and 16  None of us liked it
Everyone said this was amazing and it wasn't It was boring and dragged on Unoriginal Not realistic at all Thanks
The book is all about a history with no ending The characters are cancer kids trying to be happy that is the good part the book itself lacks of strength I did not like it I would like to have my money back
Bad book
This book really touched me I cried so may times in this book and is now my favorite book ever 
I'm easy to please when it comes to books I've invested so much time that I can't help but enjoy anything I read but this book was a disappointment
My book club loved this book  I forced myself to get through forty or so pages before quitting  I couldn't stand the smart ass voice of the teen cancer or no  I think it's a swell book for young adults  Not a middle aged woman like me  I like to read more mature takes on things
beautifully writen a great work of art this bok is life changing it ismy favorite novel and others shoukd read it i respect more people with cancer now and so do others
I did not order this app how do I get a refund This is the worst customer service I have had
Ordered a new book from second vendor Book arrived very used Ripped cover CDs not useable Sad sticky note enclosed about how i could return it but not worth the hassle
I bought this book for my son avid reader who needed an outside-reading material for school  Firstly the seller delivered and packaged the book good  No surprise there  Secondly I hated this book with a passion  It does not make sense to be so sickly depressed the parents' depression is contagious and yet go on doing things that are impossible to do with the kind of cancer that Hazel has  Boring is a better description  I am hating it so much but I promised my teen daughter that I would read it  I am forced to continue reading this book  I know a lot about cancer and the lives of Hazel and Gus are just so turned away from reality that it is a shame and John Green was able to publish this book  I love to read and learn from books and I did not learn anything from this book  John Green how did you get such great reviews  Did you pay for it  Come on this book is a joke  Of course it is meant for teens so I should apologize for mocking
You would think that a story about a teenager diagnosed with cancer would really draw you in and make you care for the characters but this was not the case for me with this book I feel the novel is almost like a Judy Blume novel written for a young audience I enjoyed reading them when I was a kid but need something more complex to keep me interested now that I am an adultI find that the best way to make reviews helpful is by adding a list of books I love and books I hated That way you can compare and determine whether you and I have similar tastes So here is my list:Books I love or at at least really really like:The Last PolicemanWe Need to Talk about KevinTell the Wolves I'm HomeWhen the Emperor Was DivineThe History of HistoryThe Remains of the DayWe Have Always Lived in the CastleThe Night CircusWater for ElephantsThe Sisters BrothersThe Poisonwood BibleBooks I REALLY hated:The Bear in a Muddy Tutu1Q84The Buddha of SuburbiaA Visit from the Goon SquadSun StormA Long Way DownWhen We Were OrphansThe Haunting of Hill HouseThe Fault in Our Stars
did u guys read dsame book coz i was unimpressed and so bored i meanreally total waste of time and money this book never grabbed my attention and those 'cerebral' conversations of d characters r so weird i mean who talks like that sorry i dont get it
I can't download the book I payed for it but the link to download is broken so I loose money time and ilusion 0 stars for this  product
Before I continue let me be clear that I am not giving John Green three stars He works hard at making the world a better place through his charity fundraising vlogs etc and I admire and appreciate him As a public figure being looked upon as a role model he gets five stars  I've been following his work for almost 5 years and I hope that he'll continue to make content for years and years to come  That's my review of John GreenNow on to the book reviewThe Fault in Our Stars starts out extremely strong  Hazel the protagonist is so wonderfully crafted that I am amazed that John Green was never actually a teen girl himself  Those first descriptions of Issac Gus and the place/event where they meet are also perfectly written  I felt like I was right there with them seeing and feeling everything as Hazel did  There are other moments later in the book that are absolutely perfect  TFiOS definitely contains some of John's best writing everHowever as the story goes on some problems stick out1) I know that this is a work of fiction but there were moments when the plot grew so ridiculous that I found myself saying (out loud) you CAN'T be serious  Fans of John Green's previous books will find that TFiOS makes the wackier moments of Will Grayson Will Grayson seem realistic by comparison  If you had trouble suspending your disbelief enough to appreciate WGWG all the way to the end you're probably not going to like TFiOSMinus 15 stars for screwing up a beautifully realistic story with unnecessary and totally unbelievable twists2) I have no objection to impressive vocabulary and deep conversations coming from the mouths of fictional teens (actually these kids sound a lot like my friends did I when we were their age) but this is like the Gilmore Girls on Adderall Every single conversation between the main characters is a rapid-fire exchange of existential questioning brilliant wit metaphor analysis and look how smart I am vocabulary Even brilliant people have relatively normal conversations once in a while  Dialogue seems to always be one of John's weak points but this time it's really more the fault of his editor  It just needed to be dialed down a littleMinus 05 stars for also screwing up the realism of the story with unnecessarily incessantly wordy dialogue3) This is just very a minor criticism but Augustus  That's the best name that John could come up with for that character  If he were a normal teenager named Augustus it wouldn't have been so bad but there are already SO MANY unlikely elements to accept about him that giving him a ridiculously unlikely name kept pulling me out of the story and reminding me that he is not and can not be real4) This is purely a personal opinion and other people will totally disagree but I didn't like the depressing message of the story One of the main themes of TFiOS seems to be the ultimate futility of everything that we say and do the ultimate meaninglessness of all of our values and relationships and beliefs We live we die the world goes on Individual lives are soon forgotten forever In a dozen decades or so nobody will remember anything about your life The people who knew you will also die and it will almost be like you never existed and you can't bank on an afterlife  That's VERY heavy stuff especially in a book targeted at teens and young adults  Not every story has to be happy and not every story has to have a moral but I wasn't expecting such a dark message in this one
Over all this was a great book Unfortunately I stopped reading it when the language was enoughat least 3 on a page and it talked about very strong relationshipsif you know what I mean 5 stars if this ridiculousness was gone :(
Another pathetic book shows in by the teachers union Lack of true it taught lack of responsibility by the teachers
It will be nice if they specify in the reviews that is actually more a teen book The story is ok but i found the book really boring
very very depressing a person with cancer or have a family member with cancer does not need any more negitive thoughts  It dwells on dieing and not of hope
I ordered this book a while back and it is now 2 weeks late I dont even know who to contact to try to get it I paid 10 dollars for it and it was supposed to be a gift
I read dozens of young adult books a year Many have difficult (even horrifying) topics so please don't say I was squeamish I also record a number of these for a non-profit each year and the voices need to ring true (I work with adolescents so I know their voices)This book is poorly written and painfully long
My 13 year old granddaughter told me about this book I am glad she did It was very good I usually read mysteries but I could not put this down Highly recommend this
Although extremely well written I can't say I have ever encountered a more depressing book  This story cuts to the core of a parents biggest fears and although MrGreene might be trying to show us how strong the human spirit may indeed be this book has not inspired me in the least  In fact it feels like it took the worst possible scenarios a parent could encounter and threw it into a book to depress its reader and show them that in case they thought their life is bad it has a high probability of getting worse  I actually wish I could unread this book and forget how depressing it wasDon't get me wrong I read Jodi Picoult which has a high probability of making me sad or bringing me to tears but this book felt like it did so much more damage in terms of its hopelessness
i dont know how this book is i have never read it but my friend did and loved it so im sure its good
When they make it into a movie John will you please make sure that the sister who is supposed to die is actually the sister that diesIs joke  Get it  Ha ha funny jokeAnyway Paper Towns sits next to my bed and on nights when my depression wins the battle over my Ambien and long droning episodes of Fresh Air it sings a soft improvised song so at least I don't spend those darkest hours in an inescapable silence  It gives a lyrical poetry to those places that don't exist in which you always get trapped  Poetry has rules you see even if it skips a line or two - because it's a sonnet whether the lovers become that final couplet or no - and all poetry's rules mean the marks on the map creating places only you have been before have rules that may eventually make you into a couplet even if the poem doesn't start out with oneI doubt The Fault in Our Stars will be staying up besides me and Paper Towns those night or nights in-between  But I have plenty of other moments in my life that are too still to be safe still enough to leave me with a brain that's not quiet right and a self with so little barriers from that something wicked that comes but from which way And from those other readers Fault will notice even through my silence and give me a warning as far in advance as it knows and hold my hand as long as I need anyway even if it can't tell either
When I read the description of the book I thought it would be a great read Once I started reading I was disappointed and the more I read the worse it got Who makes a book about dying kids with cancer What type of sick person writes about this True it is a love story but the concept is horrible The entire read I kept thinking about someone I loved getting this disease or even me That's not what I want to picture when I read a novel If this wasn't a book club selection I would have gotten my money back
Read this book if you are a tween girl otherwise you will regret it I'm not saying it's bad for tween girls I'm sure it's great but to me it was just melodramatic with an abundance of likes and umms
This book is extremely depressing and I am not in the mood to even finish it I can say with honesty that it is really well written and it tugs on the heart strings the only problem is that it makes me feel like there is no hope If I wanted to be depressed I just have to go out and talk with people
Caring parents beware  I did not feel that the language or sex in this book was appropriate for my teen  The language taking God's name in vain and at times vulgarity makes me wonder why this is a teen book
A bear walks down to a beach He reaches into the water and plucks a fish His friend died Life is meaningless he replies
